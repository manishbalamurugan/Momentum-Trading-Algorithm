0,GME Margin Changes and their implications,195,kyuu13,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyuu13/gme_margin_changes_and_their_implications/,109,"I initially wrote this as a comment but wanted to share it with the rest of you retards. There have been a lot of posts about GME this weekend but none have really gone into the implications of the [changes in margin requirements last week.](https://twitter.com/BooRileyMusic/status/1350159960877879296) This post gets long and rambly so up front **TLDR; retail shorts will be forced out creating upwards price pressure, but making the squeeze smaller and shorter** 

- The first question is, why are banks increasing margin requirements or removing margin altogether? 

There are two possible answers. Either the banks can't find the shares or they're trying to protect themselves from potential losses. Not being able to acquire shares seems unlikely, if that were the case we should be seeing low availability and high interest [which just isn't there.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) People assuming banks are worried about their clients money are wonderfully optimistic but woefully na√Øve. You can take your account from 100k to zero and the bank won't blink. What they're worried about is you taking your account from 100k to -100k. 

- The banks are protecting themselves. But from what? 

The longs, with 75% margin requirement, would have to take 75% losses before losses exceed their collateral, and after that their losses are capped. For a GME bull that entered at 35$ that means a share price of < $8.75. **Shorts, on the other hand, have their losses exceeding collateral at any price > $26.25 (assuming 35$ price) and are exposed to potentially unlimited losses.** So banks are exposed to far more risk from the short positions than the long ones.

- Banks are limiting their indirect exposure to shorts by restricting or removing client's margin. Why does this matter? Aren't most shorts institutional and not affected by margin requirements?

It's true, most of the short volume is big players, but there is a large amount of retail shorts as well. Not only will you have contrarians looking to capitalize off the correction, you'll have all the boomers and casual investors who see Cramer, CNBC, and SA articles predicting the fall. The assumption that most retail shorts are in puts I think is false. If you ask anyone on WSB they would probably make that play, but most retail investors aren't degenerate retards. Most are boomers who favor slow steady growth and get hard thinking about their 2% dividend from MCD. When they see Cramer railing millennials for taking some deadbeat stock through the roof, they log into fidelity or schwab and sell shares short. They're not on RH blowing their retirement on FD puts at 30+% premium.

- Boomers short. Banks restricting margin. What happens from here?

Last week we saw Schwab increase margin requirements first to 100% and then eliminated it altogether. Fidelity increased their requirements from 70 to 75%. Rumors are IBKR were planning to do the same. It's important to note that while removing margin does decrease bank's indirect short exposure, it has the possible effect of triggering a short squeeze if too many clients are forced to close their positions at once. That might explain why IBKR didn't end up changing their margin requirement on the same day as Schwab, and why these changes haven't been widely publicized by the banks themselves. So lets assume that banks take a gentle approach, progressively rising margin requirements before removing margin altogether. This forces some longs and shorts out of their positions over time as they become too high for the trader. But there's an interesting difference when the longs are forced to cover vs. the shorts. Say I'm long 200 shares of GME, 100 bought on margin. If the margin requirement increases from 75% to 100%, I can sell 12.5 shares and I now have enough collateral to cover the remaining position. If I'm short 100 shares with 75% collateral and the requirement goes to 100%, and I close part of the position with my collateral, my margin requirement will decrease but my collateral will decrease by an equal amount. **This means that the traders who forced out of long margin positions will only have to close a portion of their position while those forced out of shorts will have to close the entire position.** Moreover, given the recent price increase, it's likely that on average the shorts will need to cover more collateral than the longs. So shorts are more likely to be in financial distress and will have to close larger proportions of their positions than longs. The overall effect is net buying. 

- Short squeeze intensifies. Retail shorts forced out.

At this point in the lifecycle of a short squeeze with the stock running to new highs you typically have more and more short pressure- old shorts double down, new shorts see Cramer having a seizure and get fomo, some retard checks RH and sees a giant green dildo he doesn't agree with. This can potentially start the lifecycle over, if a new catalyst can force this new generation of shorts out. **By limiting retail shorting, big banks are effectively turning off the gas for squeeze continuation down the line.** 

- What does that mean for you? What do you do with this info?

Whatever the fuck you want. GME will probably have some amount of upwards buying pressure this week as banks further restrict margin, the magnitude of which will be proportional to the volume of retail shorts. Combined with /u/unlucky-prize's [prediction](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyoixl/gme_option_margin_and_other_factors_for_trading/) of volatility due to gamma hedging, I'm betting it's going to be a hell of a week. 

Positions: short 35p 3/19, 35p 4/16, 60p 1/29, long spread 50-60c 3/19

EDIT: Forgot üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Just to clarify, I would love to give a more precise prediction, but I don't think it's possible without knowing the volume of retail shorts. The best answer I can give is that the effect is >0.",1610842140.0
1,The next 'BB' ticker: BBY (Best Buy) DD,10,kyu3vx,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyu3vx/the_next_bb_ticker_bby_best_buy_dd/,35,"**TLDR**: **BBY** Rocket Ship Emoji, Calls (2/26 120-130cs or a strike near their all time high of 123) and Shares

This is so similar to the other BB ticker DDs I did that most of it going to sound familiar. If you already bought BBY on accident this thinking it was BB or BBBY and need some reassurance, you're in the right place. First, going over my retarded investing tenets to make sure my dumb plays align with it: 

Overall:

1. I'm a retard and don't know anything.

Bull Market specific tenets (if you're a gay bear move on):

1. The market is undervalued, and 

2. Small businesses are getting crushed by governments to the benefit of big business, due to COVID.

What's that mean? Stocks may be overvalued, but the entire market is UNDERvalued, so your own internal stock valuations don't mean shit. Ask yourself, ""where the fuck else would I put my money?"" If you put it in a bank, printer goes BRRRR and you lose value. The only option is real assets: equities and real estate.

So this play, another boomer ass retail chain, sounds dumb as hell when I say it. That means it MUST be good. It's a big business, which our government is bending over backwards to give free money to. Big stores have cash on hand, which smaller businesses it competes with don't. It has an online presence. Online presence sounds ""duh"", except COVID is forcing the move to online quicker than even a skilled executive could pivot. And COVID/WFH means they get to drop their unprofitable stores, employee benefits, and dead weight faster without any blow back from consumers.

All of this is even BEFORE I look at [BBY specifically](http://investors.bestbuy.com/investor-relations/financial-info/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14535249). Let's get into it:

Upside:

* BBY has cash on hand, $5.1B to be exact (which doubled since COVID began, from $2.2B to $5.1B. See? What did I say?)

* They grew online sales by 174%, AND store sales by 23%. They're being forcefully pivoted online, which is exactly what they NEEDED to do, so even if their leadership was dumb COVID has helped them. Additionally, every boomer is heading to Best Buy to set up their WFH setups with a blank check from their jobs that they can expense.

* They surprised with an EPS of $2.04 last quarter vs $1.70 expected. Margins are only getting better as they can reduce benefits, track every minute of an employee's logged in time, and shut down stores / fire people without any public backlash due to COVID.

* Remember how we all jacked off about GME console sales? BBY is BIGGER and sells more. Basically guaranteed revenue bump from this quarter that wasn't there last year, which will impress wall street because they're retarded like us and like when numbers go up. [The website has crashed over and over due to video game demand](https://www.pennlive.com/business/2020/12/ps5-xbox-series-xs-soon-to-be-restocked-online-at-best-buy.html). That sounds bad, but it's like with PTON being unable to fulfill orders... so many people want it that they're crashing the site.

* They're still below their ATH of 123 from just 2 months ago and they've only been performing the same or better since then.

* Most importantly in my mind, they are still undervalued because they didn't provide good guidance last quarter. Last quarter they beat every metric but the stock dropped from ATH of 123 to ~113 because [they said Q4 sales likely wouldn't be as high due to their high Q3](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/best-buy-bby-q3-2021-earnings.html). Well guess what, the market is already pricing in a slow Q4 for every business. There's uncertainty in this stock because of that, yet think of it: how could they have messed up extra console sales and stree-free closure of unprofitable stores? I mean, they could, which I'll go over below.

Downsides:

* Usually my largest gripe is with the people. In this case, [CEO Corie Barry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/01/21/best-buy-ceo-corie-barry-is-a-corporate-iconshes-now-accused-of-having-an-inappropriate-affair-with-a-co-worker/?sh=47abb92f5ce4) is a traditional ""okay"" CEO with a few scandals under her. If she were a really skilled CEO, Best Buy could've been one of the best internet retailers ALREADY. But I'm still going with BBY since COVID is basically forcing them online faster than she would've pushed them.

So let's recap so far:

* An actual profitable business and growing online presence, with all the benfits of having cash on hand.

* Uncertain guidance leading to wall street hesitance

* Tailwinds (gov and economic) pushing them to greater profitability (not even including new console season).

I love this play and it's one of my sleepers. People should realize BBY is similar to GME, TGT, WMT, etc and will outperform it's ""brick and mortar"" expectations online.

Retarded play: Just buy shares if you're scared

Autistic play: **BBY** 2/26 $120-130c or near their ATHs. Also ROCKET SHIP EMOJI",1610839788.0
2,"$FUBO DD - Connecting the dots, this thing is going to be a MONSTER.",61,kyt46m,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyt46m/fubo_dd_connecting_the_dots_this_thing_is_going/,49,"Pretty sure most of you know $FUBO has been shorted like crazy since the news of their Victory acquisition. It shot up 33% with the news and has since lost most of those gains. I'm here to tell you why the shorts are wrong and why this is a MASSIVE opportunity for us.

First, I'd like to address the issue of profitability. It was founded in 2015and being a young, growing company and isn't profitable yet. To put things into perspective, even Netflix which was founded in 1997 wasn't profitable until 2003. Fubo has more competition today than Netflix did back then, but it's still growing rapidly. 

Q3 Results: [https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html)

* Revenues were $61.2 million, a 47% increase year-over-year on a pro forma basis, or +71% excluding 2019 licensing revenue from the FaceBank AG business, sold in July 2020. This growth was driven by continued subscriber expansion, an increase in subscription Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and growth of advertising sales:  

   * Subscription revenue increased 64% year-over-year to $53.4 million.
   * Advertising revenue increased 153% year-over-year to $7.5 million.
* Paid subscribers at quarter end totaled 455,000, an increase of 58% year-over-year.
* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) per month was $67.70, up 14% year-over-year.
* Total content hours streamed by fuboTV users (paid and free trial) in the quarter increased 83% year-over-year to 133.3 million hours.
* Monthly active users (MAUs) watched 121 hours per month on average in the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year.

Q4 Preliminary Results:

[https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx](https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx)

* Q4 total revenue is expected to be between $94-$98 million, a 77% to 84% increase year-over-year.\* Prior guidance was $80-$85 million.
* Paid subscribers at year-end are expected to exceed 545,000, an increase of more than 72% year-over-year. Prior guidance was 500,000-510,000 subscribers.

It smashed its previous guidance because sports and normality are returning. Also note that Fubo was still growing rapidly during the pandemic despite the lack of sports which is its primary focus. This is huge and it will continue to grow faster as sports start to return to normal. 

*FUBO* is estimated to announce *earnings* between Jan 25, 2021 and Feb 03, 2021

&#x200B;

Most of us know that Fubo was opportunistically  hit by short sellers (Kerrisdale/Rich Greendfield) as their lock up period expired. This made the stock tank considerably from it's high of $60. The short argument is that integrated sports betting is a pipe dream, and that its not profitable yet. 

As mentioned earlier, it took Netflix a while to scale up and become profitable. At the rate Fubo is growing, they are going to be profitable sooner than later. This isn't even an argument to me, as they scale up a few things will happen:

\- Customer acquisition costs will become a lower and lower percentage of revenue.

\- Since they license their content, they need scale to turn those licensing costs to profit (just like Netflix did)

\- More customers mean they can charge more for advertising. (More on this later)

Fubo very clearly addressed the issue of integrated sports betting with the acquisition of Vigtory. The bear thesis is weakening significantly. Almost nonexistent. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, on to the NBA:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5)

""Over the past few years, Sky Media led investment rounds in FuboTV along with Fox for a 39% stake. This investment round was increased in late 2017/early 2018 with Sky Media holding Board positions. The former NBA commissioner was also part of the last $15 million round. Media has gone through some very big M&A shifts at the top-level with Comcast acquiring Sky and Disney acquiring 21st Century Fox. However, for FuboTV‚Äôs formative years, the company was influenced by arguably the top sports betting company in the world ‚Äì Sky Media from the UK. The Comcast-owned Sky Media is still a backer for FuboTV along with Disney.""

David Stern, the late former NBA commissioner was involved in funding of Fubo. The current NBA commissioner Adam Silver worked extremely closely with his mentor. I've been a lifelong NBA fan and I had doubts in Adam Silver but I think he's done a fantastic job with the NBA.

Why am I bringing up the NBA?

[https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/](https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/) (check the date of this and check the date of the Fubo Vigtory announcement)

People are missing some key elements to the NBA announcement: this announcement was made literally the DAY after the Fubo Victory acquisition. People are missing the link between the NBA and Fubo, let alone the timing. Fact check me, they were announced a day apart and Fubo is the ONLY company with plans of an integrated sports betting broadcast platform. 

The NBA wants to get into this because they know viewers watch games for longer with sports betting and fantasy leagues (which is why I think they threw in DraftKings)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, lets look into two key acquisitions: 

\- Vigtory - Fubo acquired them and put their co-founder in charge of integrated sports betting along with their licenses and tech. 

Balto - This one is another thing bears are missing. They claim this acquisition was to get into sports betting, it wasn't this was for their fantasy sports platform which Fubo is also planning on integrating.

&#x200B;

Fubo is going to be an absolute monster going forward. It is trading at a discount thanks to shorts [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo)

34m shares short, 62.5% of float shorted. This thing is PRIMED for an epic squeeze AND it's valued at a discount right now. 

Since the Vigtory acquisition, new price targets came out ranging from $47 to $60. 

Short term, I'm confident this thing will pop soon. It was hammered down after the Vigtory announcement by shorts, followed by a low volume selloff Friday. It's trading at imo, a massive discount right now.

Long term, this thing is shaping up to be a unique competitor in streaming/sports betting.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - get in long, one way or another. Commons, LEAPS, anything... this thing is going to explode as we inch towards earnings (expected late January to mid-February). We got massive revenue growth, we have strong tailwinds with the return of sports, we have the NBA basically saying they're in as long as Fubo can execute.",1610836628.0
3,BlackBerry does stuff,203,kysbva,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kysbva/blackberry_does_stuff/,64,"TLDR; If you are here for a lot rockets, here you are üöÄ This post contains info about BlackBerry.

I'm new here, this is my first DD post. Be gentle, retards.

# Intro

Let's start this off by saying this post has no PT, no stock opinion, no predictions on stock movement, it isn't about the stock or the moon. I do own shares, since I like 'em. You don't have to.

This post is about BlackBerry and what they do, since some of the yolo-ers here don't really know what they are buying into. Basically what I have done for you is went to their website, looked at their products and wrote some down. This is far from everything.

# Stuff they no longer do

**Smartphones**

In 2015 BlackBerry made their last smartphone: The BlackBerry Priv. According to a company with the name of a banned ticker that starts with a C and ends with NET (7.6/10) and Techradar (4/5) it was a decent phone. But BlackBerry lost its share in the smartphone sector and made the correct decision to stop.

# Stuff they do

**License their name for smartphones**

Since 2016, TCL made some BlackBerry phones, however they lost the rights to do that in August 2020. In India Optiemus is a BlackBerry licensee for the Indian market. In 2020 OnwardMobility acquired the license to make phones in BlackBerry's name, and they'll release a 5G BlackBerry device with Android and a physical QWERTY keyboard in 2021. (Which I probably will buy with my $BB gainz)

**Software (mostly CyberSecurity)**

You should check out BlackBerry's YouTube channel which contains quite a lot of videos about their products (since y'all can't read that well) [BlackBerry - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLnFGgerRGKlId9uo7dRpIw)

I'm not going to pretend like I understand anything of cybersecurity (stuff with authentication, antivirus, endpoint safety, trust,... if you know you know and if you don't know you probably don't have to). I do know however it's very important to businesses and governments and one of the most important and emerging tech sectors. This goes paired with quite a lot of money spent: its a 123 billion dollar industry \[1\]

Their software isn't limited to cybersecurity, but they do take pride in the fact that each of their software solutions are secure and enterprise-grade. They provide a file sharing application (BlackBerryWorkspaces), a crisis communication system (BlackBerry AtHoc), a BYOD solution (BlackBerry Work), messaging (BlackBerry Connect), ... you see where this is going.

**Automotive**

This actually too is software, but we'll split it up because this one is big.BlackBerry QNX is ""a real-time OS plus virtualization, safety and security solutions for tomorrow‚Äôs critical embedded systems"". Basically it's the software running your car, for which car manufacturers can develop. With cars becoming more and more digital, this becomes more and more important. Here's a video [BlackBerry QNX - The Platform for the Car - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9iggiTTbC8)BlackBerry IVY is ""a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology"". Basically this will take cars to a whole new level of customization and connectiveness. Here's another video [BlackBerry IVY - Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwDnUNENSoY)BlackBerry Radar is ""a complete asset tracking solution providing reliable visibility to trailer, chassis, containers and equipment."" Here's another video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8dOnzd-Y5M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8dOnzd-Y5M)

BlackBerry does more than written above. Like a lot of companies. They do stuff.

You should look at their Investor Presentation if I sparked (¬Æ)\* any interest, it contains a lot of pictures: [https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/blackberry-com/Documents/pdf/financial-reports/2021/q3y2021/Q3-FY21-Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://www.blackberry.com/content/dam/blackberry-com/Documents/pdf/financial-reports/2021/q3y2021/Q3-FY21-Investor-Presentation.pdf)

\*this is funny because one of their products is called BlackBerry Spark

A little background: GM has some short term catalysts in 2021 as a recovery play. It sold the most trucks in the US in 2020 and apparently isn‚Äôt yet affected by a semiconductor shortage that is forcing Ford to idle some plants, but the real story here is Cruise.

GM owns Cruise, the SF-based autonomous vehicle technology company, that plans to offer autonomous taxi and delivery services. The total addressable market is $5-8 trillion according to the Cruise CEO. 

‚ÄúDan Ammann, CEO of the GM majority-owned autonomous vehicle subsidiary, on Wednesday said that valuation includes autonomous ride-hailing services to compete against current companies such as Uber and Lyft at a potentially $5 trillion sector; $2 trillion for freight; and $500 billion each for data insights and in-vehicle experiences.‚Äù Source: [CNBC ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/gms-cruise-values-autonomous-vehicle-industry-at-8-trillion.html) 

*Why now?*

1) Cruise had once aimed to launch a commercial service using so-called ‚Äòdriverless‚Äô vehicles by the end of 2019 (so they must have thought they were pretty close). Cruise started fully autonomous taxi service in SF in December 2020

2) In January, Cruise hired the former COO of Delta, another pretty strong signal they are getting ready for commercialization.

3) In a recent earnings call, GM CEO indicated they were open to a sale of Cruise which was last valued at $19bn. In this market, if they show any sign of progress, should be $100bn (vs current market cap of GM of $71bn). If GM retains minority control, it‚Äôs all upside. [Deutsche Bank analyst who asked the question on earnings call explains](https://youtu.be/12XMATuP3_0)

4) GM crushed it at CES, unveiling a flying drone and new business called BrightDrop, ‚Äúecosystem of electric products, software and services to help delivery companies transport goods more efficiently‚Äù

*Price Target* üéØ üåù 

In December, Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Adam Jonas raised its price target to $57, USING A DISCOUNT RATE OF 30% to account for execution risk. That‚Äôs insanely conservative in my opinion, but hey let‚Äôs go with it for a second. Back of the napkin, if the present value is $57/share and the discount rate is 30%, that implies a future value of $420.69 in 7.6186 years. This market has been making moves in dog years and Jonas‚Äôs call was made in Dec, so that means we celebrating New Years 2022 in tendie town.

But seriously, I think we are going to $100 this year which Jonas also cited as a ‚Äúblue sky‚Äù bull case. Under that scenario, Cruise is spun off at $100bn valuation.

I‚Äôm just sharing my call, not giving advice. Do your own research.

5,CMPS / Compass Pathways DD - largest of the shroom stocks,26,kypw2i,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypw2i/cmps_compass_pathways_dd_largest_of_the_shroom/,13,"**Overview**

Compass Pathways PLC is a British company studying synthetic psilocybin as a treatment for depression.

**Business Overview**

CMPS is addressing several mental health diseases. There are ongoing trials for anorexia nervosa, addiction (primarily alcohol and smoking), depression, and anxiety. The global TAM for depression and anxiety alone is estimated at $18.5b. The most successful antidepressant at present is Zoloft, and it has generated over $30b in total revenue for Pfizer.

CMPS is the largest of the psychedelic pharmaceutical companies by a significant margin with a market cap of almost $1.53b (only MindMed also breaks $1b). They are also currently listed on the Nasdaq. While psilocybin research has increased significantly, they are the dominant player in this space. They now run all six registered clinical trials for psilocybin that are industry supported.

As with all the players in this space, there are concerns about IP protections and the defensibility of their position. CMPS was granted a patent (US Patent No 10,519,175) in Jan 2020 for the use of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. This patent covered their proprietary, synthetic version of psilocybin (called COMP360). The primary purpose of the patent was to protect a stable form of psilocybin for clinical use. Otherwise, you would be stuck with a product with limited shelf life and significant variability in dosing. This patent is significant because it fulfills the FDA‚Äôs ‚Äúgood manufacturing practice‚Äù standards required to get final approval for any drug.

Phase 1 trials for psilocybin are (by and large) completed. A 25mg one-time dose has been well-tolerated in several trials (in a typical 70kg subject). This has allowed for progression to Phase 2 trials. Clinical efficacy trials are starting to get published. The highest-profile study yet is Davis *et al.* **2020** JAMA Psych, wherein they found significant benefit to psilocybin use in conjunction with therapy when treating depression (trial: NCT03181529) (1).

Comp360 is in Phase 2b trials (NCT03775200 for an initial trial and NCT04519957 for long-term follow up) with a recruitment goal of 216 subjects. The Phase 2b trial is projected to finish recruitment in May 2021 and completed in Dec 2021. Depending on how the data look in May, they could begin working on Phase 3 approval through the FDA shortly after that. The primary question is how large a trial (i.e., how many subjects) will they need for Phase 3? This gets at the efficacy and number needed to treat to see a benefit (number needed to treat/NNT). The closest analog for investigational psychedelics is esketamine (aka Spravato). While ketamine has use as an anesthetic, its use in mental health was controversial (2). There were multiple analyses of the data (3‚Äì5), but the most important thing to know is that psilocybin has both a greater and a more durable antidepressant than esketamine (6‚Äì8). It stands to reason that the size of their Phase 3 will be smaller than the esketamine/Spravato trial and will proceed more quickly. Regardless, the timeline for that is still on the order of years.

The political climate is improving for psilocybin. Oregon and DC have recently voted to decriminalize it. In contrast with LSD, there is significantly more will to study therapeutic uses of psilocybin, and some reputable US universities (NYU, JHU) are leading these efforts.

Differences from the marijuana industry: An understandable comparison has to be made to the marijuana bubble. There are several key differences between the two markets:

* Higher barrier to entry.
* Lower recreational demand.
* Ability to learn from marijuana stock euphoria.

**Dilution rounds/Convertible debt situation:** CMPS has been through two rounds of funding and an IPO. Series A and B raised $105m in capital (Series B in April 2020), followed by their IPO, which raised $146.6m. They‚Äôre backed by ATIA Life Sciences who have raised $125m in November, and ATIA will be going through its own IPO sometime in 2021. Raising funds has not been an issue thus far and will get easier as trials are completed.

Dilution can be a significant hit to share price (ask MindMed holders). Looking through their F-1, on F23 (pg. 305), there are 116,455,234 shares worth of options and convertible preferred shares. There are 94,651,686 shares authorized. The F-1 has a section on dilution, but every pdf version available looks corrupted and there are missing values. Expect that any investment will be diluted at some point if the company is successful.

As a sidebar, Peter Thiel owns 7.54%.

**Outlook:**

The next major milestone for CMPS will be an interim report on their Phase 2b trial for Comp360. They have been enrolling patients for 12 months now. When looking at the change log on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov), their initial goal was the complete the trial by Dec 2020, but this slipped to 2021. Their primary completion is now May 2021; this will be when they‚Äôve enrolled all the subjects. There may be some kind of press release at that point or even an announcement of a pre-IND call to the FDA to discuss Phase 3 plans.

My thesis is that the stock will continue to cool off from the ATH they hit in December. A 10q will come out in late February; they could potentially have an update on trial progress in it ‚Äì there could also be an 8k. They will not disclose interim study results at that time. Their goal will be to wait for a splashy publication after the trial is done. The goal should be entry before then. Prior results are strong enough and consistent enough to have a favorable outlook on the trials.

Longer-term, they will be administering a Phase 3 trial. Look for a recruitment goal of 1,000 or more subjects (it will be on the order of the Spravato/Esketamine trial, which had 816). Janssen Research moved Spravato rapidly through Phase 2 and 3 trials, and it still took them four years to do the entire Phase 3 alone. CMPS has been efficient thus far, but Janssen is a J&J subsidiary with significantly more funding. A full four-year cycle would be a reasonable estimate. But we will get a better idea when the Phase 2 is done since it is already large for a trial of this type. If they can recruit patients quickly, then their Phase 3 may be faster than Janssen‚Äôs was for Spravato. CMPS also has the advantage of breakthrough therapy status with the FDA.

An all-important caveat to CMPS: this is a company with only one drug in the pipeline. If Comp360 has a negative trial outcome, then this stock will tank. There is no plan B. Administration of Comp360 is not as simple as getting a prescription and taking it at home. Patients have to be monitored by a specially trained therapist for >4 hours after administration. Even if there are significant benefits over the current therapies, clinical adoption will be slow.

My final TLDR: enter this play in the medium term after the current peak has wound down. CMPS is a better long-term hold that other players in this sector given the patentability of their therapeutic (Comp360) and success moving through trials. The science is on their side, and the political climate is more favorable than other psychedelics (e.g., LSD and MDMA).

Today I went into Gamestop with the intent of browsing around and using a $25 gift card I got for Christmas like a year ago. I have not been inside a physical GME store since at least 2018 when I bought an Xbox. I immediately noticed that they have a much wider variety of merchandise, everything from games to PC hardware to toys and clothing. So on that note I was looking to buy a new PC gaming headset since I noticed they ""have"" a ton of them. I grabbed one and went to check out. The manager informed me that they don't actually have them in stock or available to order- in fact, most of the items in the store were just display boxes for promotional purposes. I thought this was weird, but she explained that:

**1- They sell in-store items so fast that if they didn't display empty boxes the store would look entirely empty. She gave an example of 200 packs of pokemon cards that sold out completely within 24 hours**

**2- They are reluctant to fill the store with generic items that don't move fast, because that store specifically, among ""3-4 others in the state"" are going to be totally redesigned to accommodate for what she described to me as ""PC building stations"".**  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**3- They have been absolutely crushing it with sales and store interest due to COVID. She stated that people are buying things that she has never sold before, like niche Wii remotes and other items.""**

Now, we have speculated for some time that GME is going to pivot to PC parts and hardware. I noticed that they do stock some PC peripherals and a few components like graphics cards (older models, they had an NVIDIA 1660 in stock) and PSUs. 

HOWEVER, I haven't seen or heard anything regarding a full-on build station. The way she described it to me, is that customers will be able to totally spec out a PC gaming rig, and have it shipped directly to their house. She said there will likely be a dedicated store employee there to assist customers and provide advice. THIS IS FUCKING HUGE. Currently, you have to be pretty ""in-the-know"" to spec out a gaming PC properly, and the pricing makes it unrealistic for a lot of gamers. On top of that, I think there is a perception that you need a lot more technical skill to get into PC gaming. What GME is doing will allow the PC gaming market to bust wide open and become more accessible for a lot more people. And finally, some sort of agreement or deal with the big manufacturers (as hinted) would make this even more lucrative!

She also said that there is a huge push from upper management for store employees to get knowledgeable on PC gaming and hardware- she said management is pushing hard for the company to step into the future. Meanwhile during the 30 minutes I was in the store, probably 10-15 customers came through and bought at least minor items. Keep in mind this is in a strip mall in a Midwestern rust belt town- certainly does not fit the ""Next blockbuster!1!!!"" thesis.

Personally I believe this is a very bullish move from Gamestop- and bodes well for the future on top of the other well-established information out there. GME is and continues to be an excellent value play, not even accounting for the upcoming short squeeze. It sounds like the vision from Cohen and others at the top is already filtering down to the people charged with carrying it out. I plan to buy at least 50 more shares on Tuesday.

ETA from one of the commenters below, u/theodros1:

""Oh shiiitt. This is amazing. I called a bunch of my local gamestops and luckily got a very talkative sales guy. He says that Gamestop Stores will be either 1.0 or 1.5 stores. The 1.5 stores will be more ""PC oriented"" and will allow users to choose parts. He didn't confirm ""PC building stations"" but dropped an amazing tidbit. The changes started in OCTOBER.... what else happened in October? Ryan fucking Cohen. This is amazing news and hopefully we hear more about it soon in media/press release.

edit: oh shit... I called this other Gamestop and he said the ""Cohen news hasn't materialized yet""... I said him being ""CEO"" and he grunted, I think affirmatively

edit 2: called another gamestop. Overheard them talking about ""reset"" of stores when I asked which store in area was 1.5

edit 3: Found a 1.5 station, he confirmed OP's post. There will be gamestop stores where we can build out our whole PC in store. Didn't have balls to ask about Cohen as CEO though lol""",1610826393.0
7,"GME - Option, Margin and Other Factors for Trading Next Week",2813,kyoixl,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyoixl/gme_option_margin_and_other_factors_for_trading/,665,"**TLDR:** GME likely to be very volatile next week around $30, $35, $39-$40 especially. If price shoots up into the mid 50s  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ , definitely duck for cover Friday.  Margin changes are actually bearish. Consider being on a brokerage that pays to loan your shares to shorts if long, because it's very profitable. Shorts can be squeezed, but so too can longs who use call options, and shorts who use put options.

**Details:**

I‚Äôve seen a lot of discussions about GME over the past week that are missing important bull and bear elements in the thesis. This sub is so incredibly bullish  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  that unsurprisingly, there‚Äôs more missing bear arguments than bull, and bearish information is sometimes perceived as bullish (such as the margin requirement increases, which I feel are net-bearish). But there's also missing bull information, namely that more new gamma ramps exist high than low it appears, and they appear pretty large.

I previously posted about some option dynamics last week, that seem to have played out to an extent. I actually lost money on my puts because the expressed vol was less than I thought, and Friday ended up playing out in a basically neutral way from a bull/bear perspective with a mere 10% drawdown. That post is here. I correct predicted the outcome, but didn‚Äôt predict the magnitude well enough and thus my trade sucked:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis\_of\_massive\_potential\_gme\_forced\_selling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxb7dy/analysis_of_massive_potential_gme_forced_selling/)

In this new post, I‚Äôll cover what I know about current option structure (and will update once updated data for Friday comes out), and the implications (TLDR: Mostly, expect vol around multiples of 5 in stock price), as well as other trading dynamic topics that I think are misunderstood or rarely spoken of.

I‚Äôm not going to talk about my opinion of the value of the stock or the turn-around plan. I‚Äôm actually in what is a modest put position for me at the moment (jan 22 $38 puts x 80), but I fully acknowledge this could go to the moon  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  next week and I'll feel like a miniature Melvin capital (though shorting at $38 is a lot smarter than at $17) and probably deserve it in that case.

**Current Option Structure:**

I will update this as new data gets in, but you can see big concentrations of options at 30, 35, 39/40 and 45. There isn‚Äôt open interest data for Friday, but volume suggests there are further ramps at 50/55/60, but they are probably smaller than the 39/40 and 30 ramps. Normally, dealers are going to be long calls (from people selling covered calls) and short puts (From people buying protection). On GME I think we all know it‚Äôs short calls and short puts, since people are buying tons of calls from them, and also speculating with puts. As such, dealers are extremely short gamma, and that means that prices accelerate from dealer activity greatly. When the stock sells, the dealers have to dump stock (or short it). When the stock goes up, dealers have to buy.  **I believe that the Wednesday melt-up was as much a short squeeze as a gamma squeeze, as the price moved over a bunch of OTM options, forcing dealers to buy as much as 1/3 of the total float of the company to hedge!**

These patterns are most sharp at these large concentrations of strike prices, so the stock can jump from 39 to 41 a lot easier than from 36 to 38 as an example. On average, it‚Äôs about $1m of stock bought/sold by dealers per percent change. To put in context, there was a jump Friday where about 250k shares got bought and moved the price 5%. That means that if accurate, dealer activity might have been up to half in that flash.   **We don‚Äôt yet have the Friday data, but there was a lot of Friday volume. This amplification may be greater next week. This week had a gamma event on Wednesday, after which there were a ton of ITM WSB calls and OOM Melvin puts that don‚Äôt have gamma, and thus the price de-volatilized somewhat. But we may now be in a situation with a lot of near the money options, which means we could see very large gamma squeezes up or down again.**

Here‚Äôs the structure, I‚Äôll update once there is Friday OI data available. This chart assumes that calls are positive gamma ‚Äì they will all be negative gamma in this case, so predict accordingly.

[https://imgur.com/a/czrKy6X](https://imgur.com/a/czrKy6X)

Also worth mentioning is the expirations next week. Here‚Äôs the current structure for next week, using Thursday data, which I‚Äôll update once I get Friday data:

[https://imgur.com/a/4wKTspB](https://imgur.com/a/4wKTspB)

This is a lot less bearish than the Friday we just had, but again, I‚Äôll update once I get the data. It‚Äôs still a net sell on Friday as those option positions get cleared out (people sell to realize, and then buy other things in general), but more like under 1/10th of float vs the 1/3 of float we were staring at this Friday. Unless people piled into ITM calls Friday, which I find highly unlikely. As such, the downwards force this coming Friday, if this Friday was -10%, is more like -2 or -3% in a vacuum.  However, the higher the prices go into Friday, the more selling this in turn causes Friday, so in a world where we end at $55 on Thursday, I'd definitely not go into Friday long as this forced selling increases.

My sense out of all of this is:

\- The current gamma structure provides more ramps up than down from $35, but there are strong ramps in either direction. BUT, the volume suggests a lot of new put positions were established. On net ‚Äì volatility up, not bearish or bullish.

\- There is some forced selling this coming Friday, but if that was the driving force yesterday, it would be a -3% or -2% not a -10%.  Slightly bearish.

\- If the stock moons this week, I would encourage you to approach Friday with care, and a more bearish or defensive mentality, even if fundamentally bullish. Similarly, if we are in the 20s, there are situations where friday eventually becomes forced buying from a ton of short term puts printing, and a bear would not want to be short into Friday.

\- A LOT of capital went into OOM puts and calls this week targeting the week after. If the stock is not volatile, a lot of speculators bleed out on both sides.

**Margin Changes**

There was a lot of talk about how various brokerages have increased margin requirements on GME stock. Some set to 100% (Schwab), others set up a bit (TDA from 70% to 75%),  others rumored to be planning but haven‚Äôt (IBKR). The reaction of the sub is that this is bullish. It‚Äôs actually bearish.

The reason is that most of the shorts, in my opinion, are institutional. Retail will typically short with OOM puts which don‚Äôt cause much actual selling to hedge. Institutions short GME are going to have that in a giant account with a ton of other assets, so changes on margin placed on them, if indeed that happened, wont margin call them except in scenarios where GME goes up 20x in a day or something.

On the other hand, if you are a retail trader where half or all of your positions are GME, this margin change does effect you, especially if you were out on margin, and it makes it harder to buy more shares. I don‚Äôt think many retail traders are directly short the stock.  Anyone want to raise their hand and admit they are 50%+ GME and on margin to do it?

Also, consider the context -retail brokerages just did this on the back of everyone here buying shares long. That to me suggests they are looking at customer accounts, seeing some over-extension, worrying about it, and setting the rule to prevent themselves being burned. Some of you have a net worth of mostly GME in your levered account. If that gets squeezed down and a liquidation is forced those brokerages won‚Äôt be seeing the money.

So, I think the margin changes are bearish. I would also urge you bulls to not set yourself up to be squeezed, which is my next point.

**Squeezes and Short Interest**

It‚Äôs true that this stock has high short interest. There‚Äôs contradictory evidence as to if the shorts went up this week or went down. IBKR share availability suggests it may have went down, other sources suggest up, and I'll update once we have solid post-Friday data that someone posts. However, just because the short interest is high, doesn‚Äôt mean that it can be squeezed easily from here ‚Äì Wednesday I think was that squeeze. A lot of the old shorts may have covered then, and we may be looking at new shorts. It‚Äôs also possible that these institutional shorts hedged with previously deep oom call options and ironically further helped create the melt up, but didn‚Äôt take losses after a certain point.

Additionally, while GME longs here on stock are not squeezable if not on margin, those of you on OOM call options ARE squeezable, and those of you on ITM options are in a sense even more squeezable. OOM call options decay if the stock doesn‚Äôt go up, and then the shares dealers bought to hedge the call they sold you get sold back into the pool. ITM options, when sold, do the same but more powerfully ‚Äì selling a very ITM call option on GME means a dealer immediately goes out and dumps 100 shares of GME on the market. If you in turn buy 100 shares, it‚Äôs netural, or if you buy a bunch of NTM calls, you might even cause a net buy. But, those will tend to cause selling if people take money off the table and as time goes on.

And yes, there are a TON of new put options, and those get squeezed out too.

So there is a dual squeeze potential here ‚Äì shorts vs their losses and borrow fees and decaying option positions which cause dealer buying, and longs using margin and longs in call options fighting time and also watching dealers dump their hedged longs.

One other thing -  contrary to what I sometimes read, Melvin Capital was already squeezed, or rather, their dealer was by proxy.  Wednesday was that squeeze. They bought a bunch of ITM put options which forced dealers to sell a ton of stock to hedge. When the price shot up, dealers bought into that short they made to hedge the Melvin puts, and now the Melvin puts expired worthless. Melvin can not be squeezed further unless they enter a new short position of some type. They lost 55M on that trade, and they manage 20 billion. They may be back in it at this point, shorting this even harder is within their power...

Lastly, it has been brought up that some of the GME short, especially those puts lurking at $2 and $1, are hedges by bond holders against bankruptcy, or are hedges by those who sold CDS to bond holders to hedge their short CDS. Those are going to keep accumulating because bankruptcy is possible (though unlikely) in the few year range, and getting those puts now is basically free. But they won't affect the price since they are so far OOM.

**Uptick Rule**

Because the stock was down a lot Friday the uptick rule was triggered until eod Tuesday. That means shorts can‚Äôt sell at the bid to force down price they can only sell at the ask. In practice this won‚Äôt matter a ton since you can still buy puts to make a dealer do this, and my understanding is they aren‚Äôt subject to that rule anyway. EDIT - dealers do have to obey this but appear to be net long the stock currently so would not be affected. 

**Yield Enhancement Program**

A pro tip I have for this sub is ‚Äì if you intend to hold a ton of long stock that is in high demand by short sellers, you should get paid to lend it to short sellers. That‚Äôs how the option dealers make a lot of their money ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure citadel is making a killing holding a ton of GME stock to hedge, and promptly lending it to hedge funds at 30% borrow rate, while having very little risk.

Most brokerages don‚Äôt pay you for lending your shares out, but IBKR does. Right now, if your GME shares are loaned out, you get something like 15% annualized in rebates. Apparently, Fidelity and Schwaab also will do this, but I've not used their program, and you probably have to ask them to sign up. This doesn‚Äôt work if the shares are in margin, they have be fully paid and settled, but it is a substantial extra if you are a long-term believer in the stock, and on other brokerages, they get paid instead of you.  If any other brokerages have this feature that are non-institutional, please post and I‚Äôll add.

It is worth saying that you reduce the cost to short if you do this. I always allow it on my account though because I like the money more and think I‚Äôll beat the shorts eventually anyway. 

**A Few Other Thoughts on Shorts**

Institutions do sometimes hedge large short positions. It is possible that some of the calls held on Wednesday that caused the giant explosion up were hedges for short positions held by hedge funds/family offices and others.  The fact we didn't see a lot of selling Friday suggests that at least the near the money ones were mostly NOT held as hedges, otherwise they would've been more monetized. But, it's possible that the short pain is less than thought. We just don't know.

**Conclusion:**

I think the major factor here remains simply the desire of this sub to pile new money in. However, it‚Äôs hard to maintain this volatility level and ever higher prices for more than a few weeks without additional catalysts because options are getting pricey and decay will set in, and the higher the price, the more money is required to buy a share.

\- The margin changes, again, are definitely bearish. How bearish? That depends on how many of you guys bought a ton of GME shares on margin and whether or not we gap down Tuesday. I don't think it affects the short interest much.

\- The option situation is probably net bullish Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday, but net bearish Friday (slightly)‚Ä¶ but does mean that next week can be insanely volatile

\- Price moves are easier in the vicinity of $35, $30, $39, $40, and to a lesser extent, $45, $50, $55, $60 due to gamma 'ramps'.

8,Updated Potential Holdings of GME,314,kyocql,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/,105,"Hello Fellas, due to the monumental rally of GME this week followed quickly by another long weekend, I've been stuck with too much time on my hands and absolute crack energy flowing through my veins. To capitalize on these factors I've decided to create an updated estimate on the holdings of GME. üöÄ

As seen in this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link), there are a substantial amount of shares that are not for sale. I have added to it with additional holders who may be unlikely to paper hand.

Holding | Percent of Total
:--|:--
Cohen and other Board Insiders | ~19%
FMR LLC | 13.67%
BlackRock | 12.33%
Vanguard| 7.58%
Senvest | 4.62%
Permit | 2.8%

These are holders from the previous post, and I skimmed 0.26% of Cohen and board insiders (i.e. Sherman, James bell, etc.) due to the small recent sell-off of the outgoing directors, just as a rough estimate.

I also want to direct attention to these additional holders that may not sell easily:

Holding | Percent of Total
:--|:--
Dr. Michael J Burry | 2.44%
WSB Gigachads | ~6%

Burry's holdings were taken from [here](https://fintel.io/i/scion-asset-management-llc), 1.7 million shares as of 9/30/20.

WSB estimated holdings were taken from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6jjm3/wsb_owns_58_of_gme_gme_survey_update/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link)

Now Burry's holdings are outdated so take it with a grain of salt, but I doubt he trimmed most of his position before even busting the shorts. The WSB figure is an estimate and also outdated, and doesn't necessarily separate Gigachad Diamond Handers from Paper Handed Scrubs but it is a solid benchmark.

This brings the total to 68.44% of GME shares fairly secure in our mighty grasp, equating to ~47.7 million shares. Now, if you want to take in to account that GME sentiment has been absolutely skyrocketing here recently, you could place WSB holdings at 8% bringing us to 70.44% and 49.1 million shares. At a plausible stretch of 10% we would be at 72.44% and 50.5 million shares. This of course is not counting any other potential retail gigachads that could be found elsewhere such as those speds at stocktwits etc. I also wouldn‚Äôt discount the possibility that we hold more than 10%, you guys have seriously been wildin.

That means there could be anywhere from only 22 million shares to 19.2 million shares unsecured. To add to this, we have seen recent posts stating that shares shorted have actually INCREASED from the previous estimate to [79.52 million](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky4xmk/gme_shorts_havent_covered_theyve_added_only_added/?ref=share&amp;amp;amp;ref_source=link), giving a possible short to float (79.52 shares short/19.2 mill shares available) of ~400% depending on WSB estimates.

It gets better. I know were all hoping for a big day on Tuesday, and of course we would need big news for that to happen right? I mean look at the VW squeeze, over the weekend Porsche released a statement that they had upwards of 70% of the shares and that catalyzed the squeeze. What do we have that could set this off?

Ryan FUCKING Cohen. The legend still has 7% worth of dry powder sitting around and if he releases an increase in his holdings it could end this for the bears. A 7% increase would bring us to anywhere from 75.44% secured (lowest WSB estimate) to 79.44% secured (Highest WSB estimate), that would be a 550% short to float with only 14.3 million shares available. What are the chances he does that though right? Its not like hes an activist investor ;)

In short, bears are fuk and hold the fuckin line you autists the ball is literally in our court. Ill add rockets later.

This is obviously not financial advice, I‚Äôm as retarded as you guys but also a little autistic 

TLDR: The mechanisms that drive a short squeeze have shifted further in our favor. We now have more shares shorted and less shares available. If this continues the squeeze will be more violent.

WSB could own as much as 10% or more of GME shares, it goes without saying but paperhanding is the only thing that can hold us back.

Why is this important, and how can you make tendies? I believe there have been several posts in the past two weeks that share my bullish outlook on $MT, but this recent news is a fantastic boost. You can leverage rising prices in the steel market with upcoming infrastructure expansion announcements next month. I think both monthlies and leaps have a great opportunity here.

All things related to steel manufacturing are in a fight to source material, and they're doing so at record high costs. The largest source, with the capability to deliver domestically and abroad, is ArcelorMittal ($MT). They own and operate steel manufacturing and mining facilities in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa.

In addition to the existing high demand, the Biden administration is releasing a massive [infrastructure plan](https://www.enr.com/articles/50998-biden-unveils-rescue-plan-promises-infrastructure-proposal-next-month) next month.

> ""The president-elect said proposals would ‚Äúmake historic investments in infrastructure"".

$MT currently trades at $24, but has price targets [as high as $39](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MT/research-ratings).

I currently have two positions,

**1. 50x 19 Mar 2021 $25C**

**2. 25x 21 Jan 2022 $25C**

I will be adding to my March positions on Tuesday.

**TL:DR;** Steel prices are high, and going higher based on breaking news. $MT is the largest and best source for steel, with a share price that is trending up. Steel is a major component in building rocket ships. Rocket ships go to Mars.

**Edit:** Someone asked that I include [earnings data for Tata Steel](https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/tata-arm-show-hints-at-sunny-days-in-steel/cid/1803856), which is recent, and a good indicator of the steel industry.

10,Should you buy GME? Short-squeezes and the importance of üíéüëê,1843,kyn0nz,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyn0nz/should_you_buy_gme_shortsqueezes_and_the/,751,"# TL;DR in the middle (important edits at the bottom)

Long-time lurker here, finally starting to post with the imminent GME squeeze

Thought it would be helpful to give a VERY BRIEF, slightly more serious explanation on the current situation to the influx of new members:

&#x200B;

Before we start, here's a nice little glossary of autistic terms used around here:

üöÄ  = stock gonna go up

üíéüôå = holding onto a stock like a god

üìùüëê = selling like a loser

&#x200B;

So, currently Gamestop (GME) is on a pretty inevitable short-squeeze path, what does that mean? It means it's about to do something like this:

&#x200B;

[fuckin ridiculous am i right, a more recent example would be tesla \(TSLA\) if you think this is old boomer shit](https://i.redd.it/frjx9fil1qb61.gif)

Now the mechanics of it why short squeezes happen are a little complicated for beginners but here are some threads and other links explaining them IF you want to learn more:

[WSB Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/)

[Video explanation if you can't read like many of the autists here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMRyWZ6CXqM)

[Boring Boomer website explanation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp)

There also a lot of other factors at play here, but go search that on your own, there's tons of good threads here on WSB

AND if you're really serious about it, ACTUALLY RESEARCH GAMESTOP, its annual revenue, market cap, stocks in general, but lmao none of y'all gonna do that so:

So should you buy GME stock asap?

Do you like free money? Fuck yeah buy that shit üí∏üí∏üí∏

&#x200B;

HOWEVER here are some VERY IMPORTANT things you should be mindful of in these upcoming weeks:

* The very tippy top of Short-squeezes last fairly long, in the picture above (Volkswagen) it shot up and stayed there for a whole day (at around $600, it did spike at a crazy $1000 for a couple hours though), SLOWLY coming back down over a few days, then finally dropping. THIS MEANS this isn't some minute-by-minute play here, you have some time, just make sure you are prepared.
* In these coming days (or maybe weeks) GME price will waver up and down as the big corporations (Melvin üëø) start trying to cover their asses until eventually it will start spiking like crazy, the Short-squeeze will have started
* Some shit might go down this TUESDAY, it might not, but some shit will ***definitely*** go down within the next week or so as corporations are losing big amounts of money as time goes by
* THE LONGER PEOPLE HOLD üíéüôå ONTO THEIR STOCKS, THE HIGHER CORPS LIKE MELVIN WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM, this brings me to my next and final point

&#x200B;

# The importance of holding üíéüôå

The price of GME will most likely STAIRCASE upwards (going UP then down then UP, etc), as corps begin to short, people with üìùüëê (pussies) will begin to sell because of the ""profit"" they're making

Not only will you regret it when the squeeze hits its peak, but you are letting the shorters get off easy by giving them cheap stocks

Imagine this:

you bought GME at $35, it goes up to $100, you panic sell cuz holy shit thats profit, you check again in an hour and see that GME is now $200 because of the many godlike üíéüôå we have in this sub, then you start crying because not only did you hurt the cause, you missed out on a shit ton more money

***This is the importance of holding üíé***üôå

&#x200B;

Also if you read the DD (basically theory on future prospects) on Gamestop, you'll realize that it actually does have a pretty bright future, so while this may be a pump and dump for many, **I'm sure this stock will actually reach quite a large number in the not so distant future** (just google Ryan Cohen)

* My current estimation for the price target is:
* It will ***definitely*** hit $100 within the next week
* It will probably spike to around $200-$300 for a day or two
* It has a small chance of going fucking nuclear and going past $300   üöÄ   üöÄ   üöÄ  (small chance but definitely possible)
* ***It of course, also has a chance of doing absolutely fucking nothing***

Now, I didn't want to speak boomer but this is important as this subreddit is quite literally an addiction for a lot of people, DON'T PUT MONEY IN THIS STOCK IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE, WE'RE LITERALLY A BUNCH OF RETARDS (sometimes smart retards)

THIS IS NOT FINANACIAL ADVICE AND IF YOU LISTEN TO ME OR ANYONE ELSE ON THIS SUBREDDIT YOU ARE ALSO RETARDED LIKE ALL OF US

This squeeze is most likely NOT (fully) caused by us, (assuming we're around 10% of the shares) but I mean, 10% is quite a big number so we do have a little control.

&#x200B;

# TL;DR:

# THE MORE OF US THAT HOLD üíéüôå THE HIGHER GME WILLüöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ

# IT MIGHT BE A ROUGH FEW DAYS OR WEEKS BUT DO NOT WAVER, HOLDüíéüôå AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED, SELLüìùüëê AND YOU'LL FOREVER GET LAUGHED AT BY EVERYONE HERE LMAO

&#x200B;

thank you for coming to my ted talk, and yes i do have many shares

&#x200B;

**edit:** Adding a few notes here since I've already gotten so many questions lmao:

* Do NOT buy stocks with leverage/margin, as corporations can basically borrow those, aka those stocks aren't yours (as I understand it) Also stocks are better for the squeeze than options, so please try to buy stocks
* What to do if it GME plummets? You can do whatever you want to do, however I'll tell you my personal plan: I have quite a bit of money in this but I would have NEVER put it in if I didn't believe in the long term, so if this squeeze ends up being more of a pinch (very small chance), I'm not selling shit üíéüôå Again, refer to the DD and Ryan Cohens personal letter, this shit has the potential to grow 3-5x within a few or even this year
* If you ever think about wavering and think ""ooh man i'm really playing with big money i should sell üìùüëê"" think about all the other people in here backing this shit up. We have hundreds of daily YOLO threads of people dumping money in this, hell /u/deepfuckingvalue our [god](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxeq23/gme_yolo_update_jan_14_2021/) LITERALLY has like 8 million dollars riding on this shit, so learn from him and üíéüôå my brothers
* Again... if you're concerned or uncomfortable, do your own research, and come to your own conclusions. Don't take advice from retards if you don't want too

&#x200B;

**EDIT 2: DD BOOGALOO:**

If the sheer amount of autism wasn't enough to sell you on GME, here are some pretty boomer, but very important links that go into detail:

[**Gamestop's very own 2020 Holiday Sale Report**](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results)

Important thing to take away here:

""**E-Commerce sales**, which are included in comparable store sales, rose **309%** and represented approximately **34% of total company sales**, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date reaching over **$1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company‚Äôs $1.0 billion growth objective**""

This is obviously important as Cohen is most definitely pushing for bigger online presence with GME in the future, and uh yeah just the fact that it's up by *that much* is uh... üöÄüöÄüöÄ

11,PLTR FOLKS LISTEN IN - KARP AND COHEN TO MAKE >$188M PURCHASE OF PLTR WITHIN THE NEXT 30 DAYS,925,kym23z,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kym23z/pltr_folks_listen_in_karp_and_cohen_to_make_188m/,272,"Happy Saturday bois:

[https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210753](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210753)

These two boys **made HSR filings + a request for early termination** (that was granted). For those of you who don't know what this means:

HSR filings are required (amongst a couple of other requirements) when someone is making an acquisition of >$94m (this is the rate for the past year in 2020. will likely hike somewhere to \~$100m in 2021). This is what we saw with Mithril when they bought a fuck ton of shares in December ([https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/premerger-notification-program/early-termination-notices/20210675))

**Early termination requests are made to bypass the customary 30-day waiting period when someone makes an HSR filing.** This implies that the individual wants to make a purchase in less than 30 days. Both of the early termination requests were granted. Karpy and Cohen are either buying leading up to demo day/the assumed (HOPEFULLY) price hike we see, or, maybe, right around lockup expy time.

I'd leave another thicc rocket for you fuckers, but mods keep auto-deleting the post because of the image.

12,Smart money is selling at the fastest pace since 2007,258,kyju3b,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyju3b/smart_money_is_selling_at_the_fastest_pace_since/,160,"Hey guys, here is a weekly summary of charts and data that I personally looked at and thought was important. Give it a read and let me know what you think! 

Small speculative markets continue to explode higher while large cap markets rally less.

### Summary

Here‚Äôs how I approach markets based on 3 different strategies & time frames.

1. **Short term trend followers should continue to ride the rally because no one knows exactly when it will end**. If you are a short term trend follower, you **must**¬†use stops.
2. Medium term contrarian traders should go neither long nor short. Wait. Risk:reward doesn‚Äôt favor long positions right now, while shorting into a speculative rally can end in disaster.
3. Long term investors¬†should be highly defensive right now. This speculative bull market may last another 6 months or even 9 months, but in 2 years time, long term investors will be glad they did not buy today.

Bottomline: trend is up, but beware of mounting risks.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ura0cdrlepb61.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=966798cf031deec44bd7cfba01e3bdda648a17f4

Let‚Äôs keep our mind open to different outcomes by looking at both bullish and bearish factors.

### Who is buying?

A day can‚Äôt go by without another multi-billion dollar IPO exploding higher. But while traders and investors are buying small & speculative stocks like there‚Äôs no tomorrow, **almost no** **corporate insiders** **are buying their own stocks anymore**. The corporate insider sell/buy ratio‚Äôs 50 day average is at the 2nd highest level ever. It was only exceeded by 2007:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fyas2rmoepb61.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=97e6546cabba2929e20918aea1b1fa5f5aa8fc11

In 2007, stocks rallied for another half year before an epic collapse began. This isn‚Äôt to say that ‚Äútoday is just like 2007‚Äù. The future is never just like the past. But even if we look at less extreme historical cases, the next 3-6 months saw mediocre returns for stocks:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/za7o2nkpepb61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=b842ef7978be9ad8281cc7df8311c96a4feed6f8

Beware of risks like this, but also remember that the short term trend remains UP.

### Momentum

Small caps and emerging markets continue to surge higher. Bloomberg publishes a ‚ÄúFear/Greed‚Äù indicator, which is really just a momentum indicator (price drives sentiment). This Fear/Greed indicator for emerging markets is at the highest level since 2007:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r06zkoqqepb61.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=82f40c3ad08326189483588620a348e0e84ed628

This may seem scary, but Bloomberg‚Äôs Fear/Greed calculation is based on NOMINAL numbers. So as the market goes up over the decades, this figure will naturally become more and more extreme. Hence, it‚Äôs better to divide Fear/Greed by the market‚Äôs value:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uee9em0sepb61.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=42c2d3d127e1d03a7716833a7dfd0b8276164c22

Here, we can see that the adjusted Fear/Greed is high, but this wasn‚Äôt bearish in the past. When emerging markets‚Äô momentum was this strong, they usually rallied further over the next 3 months:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4m2s2hzsepb61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=8974bfb0c951f11cfb745f12bdacd8b2e4e6503f

This is a bullish reading for emerging markets.

### Breadth

Breadth is very strong across the world. The % of NASDAQ stocks at a 52 week high continues to increase:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vro2ifmwepb61.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=b142fafde00fe789ee0ee37ef546f3e1f61f0e2e

Such strong breadth readings were bullish for the NASDAQ over the next 9-12 months:

While it‚Äôs important to focus on the trend, it‚Äôs also important to beware of mounting risks:

### Speculative signs

Everything small and risky is soaring right now. An index of the most shorted, most leveraged stocks saw its 14 week RSI explode higher. The last 2 times this happened led to sharp corrections in these risky stocks:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xcq302bzepb61.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=c42849e15fed5eb2ad006aa453aa712bfeb63f7d

It‚Äôs easy to see why investors are plowing into risk. Central banks are flooding the market with an ocean of liquidity:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b79be6h0fpb61.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a9475570f09e5e1f638c0ec4cf26aeb9b6fd79f

### The everything rally

As I noted on Tuesday, stocks are rallying around the world. The average country‚Äôs stock index is 18% above its 200 dma! This is the highest reading in over a decade:

\*I calculated this average using the following countries‚Äô indices: U.S., Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, HK, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, Brazil, China, India, South Korea, Mexico, Taiwan, Russia.

&#x200B;

When so many stock markets around the world surged in the past, the S&P 500 (which accounts for half of global market cap) usually rallied a little more over the next 3 months, followed by a sharp pullback 6 months later.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h7586so5fpb61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ffd754bd546e95bc80f33a7b68522fb4a10715e

High volatility is to be expected in the coming months. The overextended rally can overextend even further, but nothing lasts forever.

Looking more closely within the U.S., micro-cap stocks (the smallest of stocks)¬†are now more than 40% above their 200 day moving average! The last time this happened was in February ‚Äì March 2000, near the peak of the dot-com bubble.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dwp03y07fpb61.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=5baf0689d43653b23922f6093e1214f76897ba67

It‚Äôs important to note that this also happened during the first year of the 2003-2007 (September 2003) and 2009-2020 (September 2009) bull markets. In those 2 historical cases, the stock market rallied another 4-6 months before major corrections began. This is a bearish sign for spring & summer 2021.

**Gamma Exposure**

And finally, Gamma Exposure recently hit a record high. High values are bearish and low values are bullish. It‚Äôs better to look at Gamma Exposure as a ratio vs. the S&P 500‚Äôs value:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y3f5o4m8fpb61.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d67c8817d9016c5def54226d5ee1b6754a7fdcb

This is a bearish reading. When this happened in the past, the S&P fell -7.3%, -7.9%, and -31% over the next 2 months from where the S&P was as of that date:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jawwim8bfpb61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=478617a7cea452af01f6db2f4736216ee8ae46bd

### Conclusion

1. Long term investors¬†should be highly defensive right now. This speculative bull market may last another 6 months or even 9 months, but in 2 years time, long term investors will be glad they did not buy today.
2. Medium term traders should go neither long nor short.
3. Short term trend followers should continue to ride the bull trend because no one knows exactly when it will end.",1610807259.0
13,Why $BB will moon üöÄ,386,kyjdkw,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyjdkw/why_bb_will_moon/,123,"So I have been doing some research into institutional money moving in and out of $BB and you Retards are going to love my findings. 

The last large institutional sell off occurred in March of 2020. A ton of five star Morningstar rated funds sold off millions of shares, I‚Äôm talking 7-8 million dollars worth per fund. 

The last large institutional buy was Dec. 31st. Multiple three star funds bought up hundreds of thousands of dollars worth in $BB. This tells us that institutional money is betting on a strong 2021. All the funds that sold in March paper handed their shares and could get FOMO if the stock continues to hold above $9. 

$BB is not even in the first 20 pages of the list of the ‚Äúmost shorted stocks‚Äù in the market... GME is number 1 and look what is happening. 

Morningstar and CFRA both put $BB with a fair value price of 6.40, so you can assume that is the absolute bottom. 

The CEO formerly was the head of a software company that was on the brink of bankruptcy that he restructured, brought back to profitability, then sold to SAP for 5.8 billion dollars. 

Biden Administration is pushing for a huge cyber security restructuring in light of the Solar Winds hack. $BB already does contract work for the US Air Force. 

This is a long term play. But the prospects of future profitability are incredibly high. Hold the line gentlemen.

What I read out of this article is desperation. Their daddies, the very hedge funds that are betting against us Wallstreetbettors, obviously push those news, place them like paid for PR. Something a lot of people have to understand, is that that is all a very normal way of playing the game. **Fake news!** Don't believe anything someone with opposite interests than yours says. 

The fact of the matter is, the net short position has increased by around 2% yesterday. They throw even more money after their bad money to recoup their losses.
The spike was caused by more and more retail and institutional investors realising this is actually going to happen and buying in.

For a lot of people (like Burry, Mashaal, cohen obviously and others) this is an opportunity. Institutions like blackrock or Senvest are buying in to take the money of the melvins of this world.

Let's compare this to other famous short squeezes: [VW Squeeze](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nr8vkBriAuo/U0RSt0E3_1I/AAAAAAAAAs0/fDcm_9XTzI0/s1600/volkswagen.gif)

15,DD for AZEK,25,kyilhg,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyilhg/dd_for_azek/,21,"Greetings,

I will be brief and not too technical on this one. ""Buy what you know."" I am a home builder and remodeler, so I am always looking at related securities. I am very bullish on AZEK for a number of reasons, some are fundamental, some are spiritual. I apologize in advance that this stock does not involve sex robots, space exploration, rna recalibration, vaccination, or any other HOT TOPICS. There are some elements of futurism in this, so pay attention.

1. Azek has a great product.  Azek's flagship product is exterior trim and molding. It is made of PVC so it does not rot. They make little plugs to cover the screw holes, so you don't have to paint it either. No maintenance. There is room to capture more of the market share as people move away from using wood on the exterior of homes. Both Lowes and Home Depot carry this material. They also manufacturing decking and railing. It also owns Versatex, which was formerly a competitor in the PVC trim category. The other PVC competitors are Veranda (garbage made by Home Depot), Kleer (made by Boral), and Royal (owned by westlake). I dont really see these as tough competition. Kleer and Royal are sold at some lumber yards, but are not sold at Lowes or HD. The word ""azek"" has become the propriety endonym for all similar products.
2. Their biggest competitor in the composite and pvc decking arena is TREX. Trex does not have a competing line of exterior trim. As AZEK's share of the decking space grows, they will outpace TREX.
3. A potential competitor in the exterior trim field is another product made by Boral called TruExterior. It is made from poly-ash and is more popular in commercial applications. Its very soft and easy to damage. It does need to be painted, and I think its total garbage. It does not work as easily with tools as azek does. (You do not need specialty tools for either, regular carpentry tools suffice.)
4. Both TREX and AZEK highlight that their number 1 competitor is wood. Lumber prices have skyrocketed during covid as a result of mills closing. This is shrinking the price gap between pressure treated pine decking (i.e low cost) and composite/pvs decking. This will push more consumers towards AZEK (and TREX for that matter). In the high end market, expensive exotic hardwoods are used for exterior decking, but with these prices shooting up even more, these consumers will also look towards alternatives.
5. AZEK sells EXTERIOR products. Builders in northern climates push all of their exterior work towards the spring and summer months. Considering the percentage of the US population that lives in cold regions (Northeast US, Northern Midlands, etc), we should expect to see sales increases starting in the early spring. I do not think the market is pricing this in.
6. They recently introduced recycling initiatives into their business. They leave collection boxes at lumber yards for the scraps and manufacture their products with recycled materials. This is a nice bit of PR for them as stock pickers start to look for these environmentally conscious companies.
7. I am not incredibly focused on fundamental analysis (because I'm a fucking meathead carpenter not a finance dweeb), but I will copy paste from their most recent presentation:
8. ‚Äì Q4 2020: Adjusted EBITDA increased 26% YOY; Adjusted EBITDA Margin expanded 60bps YOY to 25.0%
9. ‚Äì 2020: Adjusted EBITDA increased 19% YOY; Adjusted EBITDA Margin expanded 110 basis points YOY to 23.7%
10. ‚Äì 2020: Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.59, an increase of 37% over $0.43 in 2019
11. ‚Äì Net leverage stands at 1.2x at the end of fiscal 2020

This company is growing and as it does we will see the multiple grow as well. They are increasing their production capabilities, and this summer is going to be huge sales for them. The residential building industry is insane right now. The upper middle class and wealthy have been largely unaffected financially by covid, and they are the buyers for renovations, remodels, repair, and new construction. People are stuck at home and have become obsessed with improving their homes. People want new kitchens, baths, and home offices, but they also want to build decks, replace their window trim and rotting fascia.

IN SHORT YOU SHOULD BUY THIS STOCK OR LEAPS. Buy it now while it is cheap and wait for this summer when other buyers become obsessed with buying companies like this one.

Please do your own research before you buy:[https://s2.q4cdn.com/941338550/files/doc\_presentations/2020/12/AZEK-Co-Investor-Presentation-December-2020-vFinal.pdf](https://s2.q4cdn.com/941338550/files/doc_presentations/2020/12/AZEK-Co-Investor-Presentation-December-2020-vFinal.pdf)

TLDR: I am a home builder and remodeler and I am telling you AZEK is a better company than TREX.

16,GME - Directors also seem to believe there is more upside to the current stock prize. With good reason! Don't let the shorts shake you out üöÄüöÄ,291,kyi3um,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyi3um/gme_directors_also_seem_to_believe_there_is_more/,101,"See the SEC information on insider trading for GME here: https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1326380.htm

In addition to James Wolf apparently being forced to sell a portion of his GME Holdings for his funds risk balancing purposes, three other GME Directors have also sold a PORTION of their shares in the last days. 

Please notice how each of them has only sold around half of their current holdings, with Mrs. Dunn only selling roughly 8% (she is the smartest of the bunch I guess). 

Now ask yourself, why would these GME directors not just sell of all of their shares in GME after such an explosive rise in the stock's prize? 

BECAUSE 1) THEY ARE IN THE KNOW OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS TO COME  and 2) THEY BELIEVE MORE UPWARDS MOVEMENT WILL COME. 

Surely it makes sense for them to cash out a portion after such a run up, they would even be fools not to do so. However they must be aware of the short squeeze phenomenon, as well as have some insider knowledge as to the development and the future/potential of the company. If these people are willing to keep holding most of their shares in GME, THEN SO SHOULD YOU.

Here's my **personal** DD on PLTR, you're welcome to read and do whatever you want. Other helpful info or pointing out mistakes in my DD is very welcome.

Fears preventing you from buying PLTR

1. Targeted ads on your phone from Yahoo Finance or Zacks telling you PLTR = BAD!!!1!eleven
2. Shills spamming ""pLtR tO tHe MoOn"" and :rocket: on PLTR thread comments.
3. Last quarter's seemingly bad financials/earnings.
4. Financials Moving Forwards
5. Soros who owns 21 million shares ""threatening"" to sell his shares upon DPO expiry.
6. DPO expiry 3 days after February's earnings and possible insiders and DPO holders sale and dip.
7. What does PLTR tldr.
8. Other Information

&#x200B;

***#1 Targeted Ads***

Ads and articles are both paid for by someone.The fact that in the past 3 weeks i've been getting multiple multiple targeted ads on my phone related to PLTR since i love PLTR so much.

Ads are telling me that PLTR is bad, doesn't provide a dividend, they're telling me PLTR's fair price is 20 instead of 25 based on some financial model and have gone as far as to provide a list of alternative stocks to buy.

To me, this all screams: **SCARE TACTICS**

Additionally, the last few weeks of ups and downs in PLTR's stock price is another indication of the attempts to short the stock to sh!t and drive investors out. (For what reason? I don't know.)

&#x200B;

***#2 Shilling PLTR***

I myself love to shill PLTR to people whenever i can. I do this because i legitimately think this company will do great. I work as a product manager in a software development house and understand what PLTR does. PLTR is not cryptic.Regardless, i think when people shill PLTR to you, they are right to do so as you're probably missing out on a great opportunity to make money in the long run. If you're looking for big gains short term, maybe try something else.

Shillery is OK, but at least give the facts.

&#x200B;

***#3 Last Quarter's Bad Financials***

If you'd done your DD not by searching reddit posts but by checking PLTR's actual quarterly report, you'd know that PLTR's ""bad"" last financial quarter/earnings were due to the costs of listing themselves on the *New York Stock Exchange*.\~855million were spent on listing and stock related compensations and this is the big reason.

**Direct quote by PLTR here:** [https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)

>We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.

I would like to remind everyone that this is a **1 TIME THING.** Put simply, this means that PLTR won't have as excessive losses next quarter as they did this last quarter.

*Additionally*, let me go into further detail on this and not just leave it to that.

* ***PLTR's quarterly operating expenses for the past 3 quarters were at around \~260 million.***
* ***PLTR's operating expenses this quarter were \~987 million.***

ADDITIONALLY...

PLTR also had a higher R&D cost this quarter that just passed. Normally they'd pay 80 million on R&D, but somehow ended up paying \~300 million this quarter. No one knows why, but this is another thing that influenced PLTR's earnings.

[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx)

>On September 30, 2020, in connection with the Direct Listing, we incurred $769.5 million and $8.4 million of stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs and growth units, respectively, that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition as of such date.

&#x200B;

***#4 PLTR financials moving forwards***

PLTR is deep in bed with the government and the Biden regime although may look like it would be against using PLTR is in fact secretly very pro-surveillance e.g pro Palantir.

Here's some of the known organizations in the US Govt that use PLTR:

1. CDC
2. Office of the Secretary
3. Food and Drug Administration
4. Immigration and Customs Enforcements / ICE
5. Internal Revenue Service / IRS
6. National Institute on Drug Abuse
7. DOD/ARMY - ACC Aberdeen Proving Ground
8. Coast Guard / DHS
9. DOD/NAVY - Naval Information Warfare Systems Command
10. US Attorney's Offices / DOJ
11. US Special Operations Command / SPEC OPS

Boys. The big institutional people know these things. You just found this out. See how deep PLTR is already in bed with the Government?????? Palantir IS the next Raytheon/Lockheed of DATA aggregation and visualization.

***UPCOMING EARNINGS***

I've done some quick maths and it looks like PLTR is more likely to be in positive earnings this quarter and with a 0.02 cent EPS target, we can easily assume that they'll destroy this with maybe 0.04 or 0.08 EPS. In the worst case scenario, PLTR's EPS this quarter could be somewhere around MINUS -0.05 ish due to interview costs and ad/campaigning costs that were not there before the company was listed.

***WHAT CAN DESTROY PALANTIR***

Now, there's big possible downsides and Palantir can fail IF contracts that expire are not renewed. That's biggest REAL reason for Palantir's balance sheet getting screwed.

I've seen a disturbing pattern with PLTR's financials and that's that every year, it's R&D cost is rising by between 150 and 350 million dollars. This is quite a bit of negative revenue and if new contracts are not constantly coming in, PLTR's balance can start going into the negative.

***WHAT WILL NOT DESTROY PALANTIR***

Some people may have concerns over the new left leaning government dumping PLTR. An article was posted that is behind a paywall EVERYWHERE that goes something like this:

[https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cdc-officials-urge-biden-team-to-dump-palantirs-covid-tracker)

In my opinion, i believe this is inconsequential and that a few people crying to daddy Biden to kill a multimillion contract with PLTR is a stretch. Also we know the current new Biden team has his hands full and will have them full for at least the next 1 year with what's going on.

There is no time to deal with a few crybabies and even if he did deal with it and did decide to kill the PLTR Tiberius Covid tracker contract with the CDC which he WONT, these things take months and years to deal with, and by then the contract/s will have already brought PLTR tons of money and revenue in.

***HOW MUCH DOES KARP AND HIS GOONS GET PAID***

Short answer is... A LOT. The amounts below are PER YEAR. That's a lot of money in the hole and contributes to annoying amount to why PLTR is always just at the edge of just barely being profitable.

https://preview.redd.it/ba58nqcurob61.png?width=2615&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d45833faad4d60ea8dc142a9601c44b4cc7395

Palantir's prospectus 311 page document's 130 last pages are almost all exclusively talking about extremely complicated options trading schemes that are made by Cohen and others to make sure they can squeeze out a LOT of money out of PLTR.

Mithril Investments has existed from before and is not a new company. Owned by Thiel/Cohen/Karp as a way to launder and exchange options for more options and more money for all 3 of them. Also Shyam Sankar to me feels corrupt which scares me a bit, he's had some very shady dealings and has brought his wife in PLTR that gets paid 200k per year.

Prospectus Document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm)

I suggest you skim through it, it contains EVERYTHING about Palantir.

**Palantir is going to need to have to be getting AT LEAST 500 million in NEW contracts per year to REMAIN BARELY profitable. It's doable in my opinion, but just barely and it's why they made the company public to try and get more people's attention and increase the inflow of contracts.**

&#x200B;

***#5 Soros and his 21 million shares***

First of all, i think we can all agree that Soros can suck it.

If you've read a few articles here and there, you'll know that Soros owns/owned 1% of Class A PLTR shares. No one knows whether he's sold them yet or if he's an DPO holder who'll sell 3 days after February's earnings.

Whether he sells them or buys more will be mostly inconsequential in my opinion. We see dips and pumps every day. He legally cannot sell his shares all at once, he'll have to sell certain amounts daily and over time. This will create annoying sideways motion as shares exchange hands and consolidation starts for 2-3 weeks until his and insider shares exchange hands.

Nothing special to see here, move along just a little draw down resulting in some consolidation.

PLTR is exposed to OIL more than anything, so fluctuations in the general market and general market crashes affect PLTR much less than other stocks. Also PLTR does not track ANY benchmarks. NONE.

&#x200B;

***#6 DPO expiry 3 days after earnings in February***

To my limited knowledge, this is how BIG plays who are holding DPO shares usually work:

* If a stock has performed well up to earnings and investors are more than happy with the returns, they're more likely to not sell their stock or just sell less than they normally would.
* If a stock hasn't performed as well as investors thought, these investors are more likely to sell stock or reduce their positions more than normal.

There's a total of 1.16Billion Class A PLTR shares currently (Give or take don't flog me). We are currently trading with \~250 million shares while the rest are locked away in the DPO.

When those shares are ""unlocked"" in February, the price of the stock won't be diluted. These shares already exist and are accounted for. They are simply locked. Also when they are unlocked, the share price won't simply multiply because all shares are now tradeable.

>According to [Palantir‚Äôs after-hours filing with the SEC this afternoon](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm), the company has 1.16 billion Class A shares, 484 million Class B shares and 1 million Class F shares on its cap table outstanding today, or a total of roughly 1.64 billion. Only Class A shares will trade, and Class B and F shares are convertible to Class A shares on a one-to-one basis. On a fully diluted basis, which Palantir says represents 2.2 billion shares total according to its most recent S-1 filing, the company is valued at $16 billion. The difference between those two aggregate numbers comes from outstanding stock performance grants, warrants and other financial instruments.

What **WILL** affect stock price:

* Employees exercising their non class A options into Class A shares. This IS dilution.
* The bigwigs e.g Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a few other bigshots exercising their options and then selling them for a profit.

*To note, regular employees will barely affect the price of the stock with their miniscule share holdings. Alex Karp, Peter Thiel and a handful of other high ranked executives in PLTR are the ones that will create a tiny but manageable ripple in the stock price.*

What **COULD** affect the stock price a lot:

* Massive sell off by the big institutional holders.
* Not shorters. (Citron and Citi can suck it, we're in control here)
* People with weak spaghetti wet paper hands.
* Everyone fomoing the same weeklies e.g like when everyone bought Jan 15 calls on everything.
* Big but silent scare campaign (that's already going on) to scare off normies like us.

&#x200B;

***#7 What does PLTR do, tldr.***

Imagine Facebook's database of everything about everyone & Youtube's Database of everything & Geolocation data in a database made by the US Army for known terrorist cells.

Palantir allows you to select and match varied data TYPES from several different database, combine it in any way you want and visualize it so that it's human readable by even the dumbest person in the room so that even they can see patterns and come to conclusion on a subject matter.

It's kind of like filling an excel sheet with data and then visualizing it with a bar chart, except the date you filled the sheet with can be anything and not just numbers or dates or countries and you can make various combinations using all the different rows of data to maybe come up with a pattern to something like how to best distribute the Covid vaccines in the counties in a very specific state in the US.

Literally what you see in SciFi movies where people combine random data by smashing keys on a keyboard and somehow find the murderer, the location of a terrorist or the percentage that someone will commit a murder in the future based on a lot of random data about that person or the area, country, family, history... anything.

While this all might sound super cool and amazing, it is. Maybe in 10 years time there will be a few more companies doing this, but for now, it's only Palantir, Circles, Alteryx and a few other private entities that do this type of thing. Many of them work with governments and are hush hush due to the kinds of things they use this type of software for (terrorist cells, warzones, etc) and the public backlash this could cause.

tldr: Glorified data aggregator and visualization platform/software with different access levels for different people.

**PLTR is superbly positioned to offer their software to SLOW and Boomer like organizations like Governments.**

Governments are stupid and don't have neither the time, nor technical knowledge to develop this software themselves for internal use. This is what PLTR capitalizes on and why Governments use them so much.

Governments could have spent the a fraction of the money they spend on PLTR contracts to make the software themselves but only for their own internal systems and use, but they can't and if they tried, they'd fail because technocracy in governments is not a thing. By the time they'd even complete a project like this, it'd likely be out of spec, unusable and would require further development and money and we know how slow and bad governments are at doing even the basics. Again PLTR wins because of this.

**PLTR is likely NOT** to be adopted by giants like Google or FB or other modern tech organizations of any size because they are not stupid. They have their own purpose built internal systems that they use to do everything related to data aggregation and visualization because they have the technical knowledge and resources. Buying PLTR for their use is a joke.

PLTR capitalizes on being general a general purpose tool and is set up manually by an engineer over the course of 4-10 days for each customer. The engineer customizes and configures the system for each company's custom use since the software allows you to do so. Regular aggregation and visualization software CAN do the same, but typically lacks data input types and features that PLTR has because PLTR has cultivated a special set of features over many years that were suggested by their existing clientele in battlefields and other places.

Now friends, here's my position on PLTR. I'll be holding onto it for the next year. If it's not at least 300% by then, i'm selling it and moving on to the next stock. App i'm using is Revolut.

Also yes, i'm ALL-IN only on Palantir because i know my money will multiply itself in the short term. I'm not holding this till 2025 as others are supposedly doing. I'm selling in 2022 with 300% or more profit. PLTR is severely undervalued, underpriced because it's a DPO. Give it till EOY and we're going to be rich. If it was an IPO it'd be trading at 180+ already imho.

I've spent the last month and a half holding PLTR. I've gone full schizzo mode when it comes to PLTR. I lose sleep daily and i love it. I hadn't slept for 37 hours a few days ago because i spent so much time researching PLTR and scraping the internet for all possible information.

I come from an IT/Development background, so i understand what PLTR does completely.

My PT's for PLTR are:

* 48-89 by March or April.
* 75 - 125 by EOY.
* 200+ 2022 IF they solve their income and constantly increasing R&D cost issues.

19,PSA: Do NOT buy GME on margin,772,kye7o9,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kye7o9/psa_do_not_buy_gme_on_margin/,195,"First: üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Now, on to the business at hand.

A lot of you are making the correct choice in buying shares at this point in the game while waiting for the short squeeze - which could be coming as soon as Tuesday now that SEC Rule 201 is in play. 

But some of you are extra greedy/retarded and are buying GME ***on margin***

I'm here to tell you that you are potentially fucking over the short squeeze by doing so. 

**If ""Fidelity and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated margin"" it means all the traders that bought on margin will get a MARGIN CALL and be forced to either liquidate their positions or add more funds.**

That means the 100,000 shares you bought on margin are going to be forcibly liquidated when you can't cover the actual cost of getting them. 

**This will force prices down.**

And I know for a fact that most of you have zero porfolio diversity to liquidate, especially retards who are buying GME shares on margin. 

**tl;dr:** If you're buying GME shares, you want to buy with cash on hand and nothing more

Alternatively, buy LEAPs with as high strike as possible - follow u/deepfuckingvalue and hop on mid-April calls

Finally: üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Ryan Cohen is all in on GME. From the jump, he has been committed to turning Gamestop into the Amazon of games. He has a throbbing raging hard on to blow GME to the fucking moon. He shitposts on his Twitter about Blockbuster and Jim Cramer. GME is forcing T-rex dinosaur looking wrinkly tapioca pudding eating old fucks off the board. RC is a fellow autist.

But more importantly boys: He's a fucking billionaire. He bought 550 Million dollars of Tesla last year.

GME has 71 Million shares and Papa Cohen can exercise purchase of 7% to up his ownership. That's roughly 5 million shares. 5 Million X $36 is 180 Million. Why would he not spend 1/3 of what he spent on tesla on his own vision? Why the FUCK would Papa Cohen not suck up the rest of his entitled shares to throw green dildos at the shorts. He's an activist and believes in the mission. He can afford it.

I believe we will see news over the long weekend (the perfect catalyst) to increase his %. This would be the ultimate dick slam in the faces of Melvin, Wallstreet, and all the gay bears.

Argentina and Russia are amongst the world's largest corn exporters globally. According to data released by the world's top exports in 2019, Argentina ranked 2 amongst top producers while Russia ranked 8, exporting approximately $4.2 billion and 854.4 million dollars worth of corn. In the 2019/20 season, Argentina had reserved 38.5 m of corn for export. To date, of the total 38.5 M set aside for export, 34.5 M has been authorized for export. During the month of December 2020, the agricultural ministry announced a ban on corn exports, suspending sales for export till February 28, 2021, to control domestic food prices amidst a recession and the COVID-19 pandemic.

‚ÄúU.S. farmers, who harvested some of their largest corn and soybean crops ever last fall, will reap the highest season-average prices for the crops since the heady days of the commodity boom that ended in worldwide surpluses seven years ago, said the government on Tuesday. Commodity prices are on the rise due to tightening global supplies and large purchases by China, the first country to rebound economically from the pandemic.‚Äù

THIS IS BASIC SUPPLY AND DEMAND ECONOMICS PEOPLE

In a bundle of reports, the USDA said U.S. stockpiles of corn and soybeans, the two most widely planted crops in the country, would shrink to their lowest levels since 2014 when this year‚Äôs crops are ready for harvest. At the same time, the average farm-gate price for corn and soybeans this marketing year would be the highest since 2013/14.

The corn crop totaled 14.182 billion bushels, the fifth-largest on record and the soybean harvest, at 4.135 billion bushels, was the fourth-largest, said USDA in a final look at 2020 crops. The figures were smaller than expected by traders, so prices zoomed at the Chicago futures markets. Corn for delivery in March rose by the maximum allowed in a day, 25¬¢ a bushel, to end the day just above $5.17. March soybeans soared by nearly 46¬¢ to close above $14.18 a bushel.üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåΩüåΩüåΩüåΩüåΩ

TLDR AND POSITIONS AT THE BOTTOM

# Overview

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and subsidiaries is an omnichannel retailer that sells a wide assortment of merchandise in the Home, Baby, Beauty and Wellness markets. It's subsidaries include Buy Buy Baby, Face Values, and Decoris.

      * virtual rooms and improved ui to elevate customer experience
      * develop omni capabilities

# Turnaround Plan

* **Deepen Relations With Customers**
   * Retain and grow their **INCREASING** customer base with incentives and marketing
   * **Focus on their 5 segments in marketing**
      * the juggler, the innovator, the nester, the creative, and the minimizer
   * create **loyalty progams** to increase retention
* **Resetting Product Assortment**
   * Releasing BBBY's unique **private label brands** to penetrate the market and raise margin
   * increase the range of prices on products to invite lower spenders to the store
   * creating ""destination rooms"" to **elevate customer experience**
* **Offer competitive pricing**
   * BBBY wants to remain competitive in pricing while filling price gaps between products
   * **Study promotional data** to **maximize return** on coupons
* **Omnichannel**
   * Integrate physical locations with the digital setting
      * BOPIS (buy online pickup in store)
   * This will allow customers to venture into physical locations as well
* **Remodeling**
   * As stated earlier BBBY wants to **create customer friendly stores**
   * Currently, BBBY's stores look like ugly department stores and things are unaccessible
   * They are remodeling **450 stores over 3 years**
      * **the remodels are exactly what I wanted to see**
* **Creating stronger technology platform**
   * Better app and better website = more digital sales

As a BBBY shopper, **this addresses ALL my issues with the stores** atm.

As an investor, it's clear that **BBBY knows their audience and how they can regain market share and capitalize on their customers.**

Tritton clearly has a **GREAT vision** and **knows what he needs to do to** make it a reality.

REMEMBER this is a 3 year long plan, which means it will take time to fully come to fruition.

**If this is successful, BBBY will be a leader in the industry and the stock will reach highs unseen for years. With the leadership, I expect BBBY to successfully execute this plan, constantly top expectations, and prove the shorters wrong.**

# Q3 Financials

* **Profitability**
   * Profit margin is at a **historically high level of 35%**
      * **10% increase YoY** lead by lowered payroll, improved promo management, and product mix
   * SG&A **lowered** by 41 million
* **Cash Flow and EBITDA**
   * **Cash flow of 244 million** compared to a **negative** cash flow last year
   * EBITDA **growth of 168% from -.38 cents to .08 cents**
* **Comp and digital Sales**
   * For the first time in 6 years, BBBY is showing comparable sales growth in the last 2 quarters
   * **Digital sales up 94%**
   * In store traffic **decreasing**
* **Market Share**
   * For the first time in ages, BBBY saw market shares growth in the Home and kitchen departments
   * Reversal of a negative trend in other departments
* **Cash and Debt**
   * Cash is increasing to a solid 1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents
   * debt lowered by 500 million (25%) this year
* **Revenue and Net income**
   * Revenue is DECREASING by 5% YoY
      * Tritton closed TONS of low performing stores and will continue to do so
      * also sold failing businesses
      * this will hurt total revenue but raise net income
   * Net Income is INCREASING
      * lower performing stores gone means higher profits

Yes, earnings missed estimates, but as Tritton said, **he is doing everything he said he would do.**

**The balance sheet is improving, he is executing his plan steadily, and he is overall reassuring investors with his buybacks.**

BBBY is focusing on optimizing their top performing stores as the country is over satured with stores currently. With unprofitable stores closing, **we can expect a decreasing overall revenue, but an increasing net income.**

As the plan continues, I fully expect overall revenue to **reverse the trend, and begin increasing.**

Investors were also disappointed with guidance, but **Tritton has mentioned that he is being CONSERVATIVE in estimates**. He has always one to be conservative and deliver more than expected.

# Tailwinds

* **Growing customer base**
* A general **shift towards home improvement**
* **New private label brands** are profitable and would help gain market share in 2021
* **150 stores** being remodeled in 2021
* **Stimulus** and perhaps more from Biden
* Return to ""normal"" would lead to a **large surge in marriages and babies**

# Headwinds

* COVID worsening and restrictions returning
* **Twitter trying to get BBBY cancelled for selling MyPillow**

# Buybacks

Normally, I am against share buybacks. BBBY used them previously to suppport a dying stock, but here it's different.

BBBY currently has an accelerated share repurchase program of 850  million dollars with 150 million to be repurchased by february 29th.

With excess cash from selling unprofitable businesses, **Tritton seeks to regain investor confidence WHILE producing obvious changes and results.**

Due to these buybacks, I expect share prices to grow over the next few months leading up to earnings.

# Short Interest

Currently, short interest is astronomically high at \~70%. I believe that this has decreased as a hedge fund bearish on GME and BBBY seems to have covered at the same time.

Check the spike on GME and BBBY 1/13 11:30. It's likely Melvin or mapleridge covered a short position.

With Cramer pumping and this, we saw a mild squeeze, **but there are no more catalysts to cause another for a while;** however, with buybacks and strong performance, shorters will slowly buy back their shares alongside BBBY, causing **a steady rise in price in the following months.**

**If the turnaround plan is successful, shorts will have no reason to remain bearish, and BBBY will grow exponentially in price over the next 6-12 months.**

# Conclusion

**Bed Bath and Beyond is on the road to success.**

**As a consumer, their private label brands, store remodels, and specialized marketing changes are exactly what I want to see.**

**In a growing industry, strong leadership, buybacks, and a beautiful turnaround plan make me bullish on BBBY.**

**I do NOT expect growth akin to what happened this week, but expect strong growth as the sentiment towards BBBY changes and their plan succeeds over the next few months.**

# I am bullish on BBBY and will be until Tritton leaves

# TLDR

Tritton will take us to the moon. Calls for the brave (dated far out), shares for the weak.

Great leadership, good plan, good industry üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåöüåöüåöüåöüåö

**Let‚Äôs dig in deeper**

**Why Nuclear?**

Nuclear reactors generate virtually emissions-free power which means they can form a part of getting to net-zero emissions from electricity generation in the fight to tackle global warming.

**I thought nuclear equals bad?**

Unless you‚Äôve been living under a rock, being green and sustainable is hot. There are currently no safe or clean ways to generate the amount of sustainable energy that nuclear does. Also, as the world population grows, unless there are giant leaps im technology, the only viable way to create enough power will be through a combination of nuclear, solar, wind and water.

**Biden‚Äôs administration has a $400 billion dollar sustainable energy proposal and it includes nuclear** 

This is rare. What‚Äôs even more rare is that he‚Äôs one of the only presidents to run on a platform *supporting advancement in nuclear energy.* He is serious about it. 

**That‚Äôs right, there‚Äôs a reason EVs mooned last year and will continue to do well for the foreseeable future. It‚Äôs the same reason there is potential for it to happen to the nuclear industry:**

**‚ÄùBut I‚Äôm republican. I can‚Äôt agree with Sleepy Joe...‚Äù**

You‚Äôre in luck! This is something so appealing that everyone and their racist grandma can hold hands and sing Kumbaya on. Bipartisan political handoff shows this is an opportunity area that even politicians can agree to.

**Even Nuclear industry folks seem highly positive in their world which has been fear mongered and neglected for decades:**

*""Things we've seen out of the Biden campaign and the transition team are very promising for a continuation and even acceleration of programs and policies that will support nuclear energy,"" said John Kotek, policy development vice president for the Nuclear Energy Institute*

24,Unusual Options Activity 101: Whale Watching Tips,776,ky9m34,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky9m34/unusual_options_activity_101_whale_watching_tips/,212,"This is long, if you‚Äôre uninterested skip to the ten tips list or TLDR

A while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my ~~gambling~~investing.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.

I'm using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.

**Tools**
I use barchart in tandem with Unusual Whales. For barchart, you can honestly get by using their free version, you just can't sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan, and they have a good stocks volume standard deviation tool.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.

There are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.

**Basic Concept**
Long story short, you're ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it's flagged as unusual activity since it's a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if ""they"" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.

MM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and the like.  However, they can't get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.

**Hunting the Whale**
So I've got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I'm looking at don't expire past a couple weeks out (more on why later), then I'm ready to eye scan.

I typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonks that do NOT have earnings imminent.**  To make sure I'm looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.

**1) Clusters of orders‚ÄîABNB example**
The way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I'm looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I'm looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  

**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it‚Äôs hedging against itself as it‚Äôs own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can't just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he's got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don't want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since the puts represent a smaller volume in the call/put ratio.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger stock position they hold, these types of option clusters indicate that the option order itself is the big, independent play, and it's hedging itself with lower volume order vs the higher volume (4,000 calls to 1,000 puts).

**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check the tickers general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter of their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it's a good nerd play.

**Example**: Here's the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unfortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.

[ABNB UOA](https://i.imgur.com/mYDXYmN.jpg)

So, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all these options showing up at 12:52‚Äìthat's our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute timespan, with some put orders showing at the bottom of the cluster.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  *Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge‚Äîwe‚Äôre onto something.*

**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don't like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after the cluster pictured above.

Passed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.

**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**

The same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven‚Äôt had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend‚Äîthis makes the order unusual, and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it's probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn't the best example of the week because there wasn't a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don't have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)

[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/GGr5bra.jpg)

A better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That‚Äôs a flag for us‚Äîsporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD SPCE OTM calls sprinkle in, ARK invests to kick off AH, SPCE moons. 

**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**

Seeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes that day to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up

[https://i.imgur.com/muVGtq2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T54peER.jpg)

Sometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.


**How I‚Äôve Fucked Up 1: Don‚Äôt get tricked by trends**

Although we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just trend-riding lemmings who follow what's already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  So, when you see shit like this below, take a minute to think before you get excited:

[NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP](https://i.imgur.com/JCZBx2s.jpg)

It was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that's already like 400% IV, just...don't.

**How I‚Äôve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM‚Äôs some breathing room**

*Even if you‚Äôre confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two further out minimum, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can't do either of those things because you can't afford the premium just skip that play and check back for something new later; I promise a better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.

Breathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I'd given them a week's breathing room, it would've been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.

**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker orders that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday's EV run or this Friday's tech bounce could be next week's airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.  Shop with a short term eye, buy with a long term choice. 

**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH:**

**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales

**2)** If you don't have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping

**3**) If you don't have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whale bets on is a 'sell the news' event, and you won‚Äôt recover from a drop especially if there is IV crush involved. 

**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out

**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs

**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial (then continue it) and unusual whales--they're each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD. 

**6**) You don't need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it's a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you're not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, whales can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they *aren‚Äôt* bagholding a call until it's in the money like you are. You may be 10% up waiting for the next 80% GME day while your whale has sold at their target 5% profits on the play and is chillin. 

**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won't be able to do shit about it and you'll hate yourself when it's a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.

**8**) Make sure the ticker you're chasing isn't just ER anticipation/bets.  Always check earnings dates before buying.

**9**) Remember whales are people, so they can be stupid, too.  Don't baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come.  They are gambling addicts just like you, except they have more money.

**10**) Always take profits if you ask yourself if it's time to.  If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close the position.

**Positions**:

TLDR
Use a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements.  Look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via call/put ratio, and do a legitimate check for TA and catalysts to confirm their moves.  Never follow a whale into a weekly, but use weeklies are your best screener.

They are one of the best bang for your buck companies in the sector. 3.5b in revenue and the market cap is only 3b with a p/e of 15. Market cap at 1 times revenue!!! Like seriously wtf is that.   

Biden is going to invest in environmental, social and governance sector which means there will be a huge payout for solar. Tax creds and tariff reductions baby. CSIQ already announced US largest PV and battery storage without a peep from the market. Methinks it‚Äôs cuz everyone on SPWR FSLR RUN and whatever other solar company with p/e 40+‚Äôs nuts.

And people be like ‚ÄúCanadian solar is actually backed by China and has no exposure to US‚Äù. To those people I say fucky fuckity fuck you duck. CSIQ is a global company with a subsidiary called Recurrent Energy which just sold a huge project in Cali.

Along with that, people been bankin on EV and that bubble bout to bust. However people still want a hand in clean energy or just green renewable companies in general. My guess is that these autists will rotate over to the solar sector which due for a massive pump like 2015-2016.

A few weeks ago, I posted some DD when they were trading at $23 and some retards said it will fall harder to $15. As always, üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüß∏ get fucked. 




Virgin Galactic has had a rocky past - 15 year company with not much to show for it. But in this past year, we had SPAC rockstar Chamath breath fresh life into the venture. Here is why SPCE will win in 2021. 


1. Public financing is helping the company ramp up their engineering efforts. Their test pilots are certified Air Force badasses. They are ready for take off üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ





2. Mama Cathy announced a new ARKX space etf which is very likely to hold shares of SPCE. That news alone sent us up 20% and we don‚Äôt even have a launch date. 




3. In an interview about his recently passed mother Eve, Sir Richard made an off hand (likely accidental) comment about being proud to fly to space in a ship named after his mother *in the next 2-3 months*



4. Branson is the OG mementrepreneur. He‚Äôs been doing this since the 70s and owns an island. When he goes to space with Justin Bieber and Ashton Kutcher, we‚Äôll be in (sub) orbit üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ



5. The CEO was a top Disney exec. He understands the power of scale and pricing. His goal is to eventually bring prices down to $10,000. So if any of you tards plan on still being alive in 2040 and want to go to space for cheap, it‚Äôs in your best interest to support the company




6. ‚ÄúBut what about SpaceX!? Elon is king and I want his hot load in my mouth!! Branson is a BOOOOMER!‚Äù Ok...SpaceX and VG operate in very different markets. And you all are poor degenerates so it‚Äôs not like you can even buy pre-IPO shares anyways. VG is the best play for someone who wants to invest in a company that will bring space to the masses. Also, a Musk-Branson collab is very likely if SPCE takes off. They are not direct competitors and will be huge PR boost to both. That should satisfy all your Elon boners

I've compiled google trends comparing Amazon searches over the last 3 years. Then, I correlated that information with Earning Reports. Keep in mind this doesn't take into account people using the app store. 

TL;DR. I've deduced that Q2's huge boost from earnings could have been easily been spotted using Google Trends. Also, I've found the overall interest in searches during Q4 this year is better than 2019 Q4 Google trends, in which the underlying had an 8% pop from Q4 ER. Keep in mind Consensus Estimate is almost double that of 2019 Q4 ER. 

&#x200B;

To help you make sense of the Google Trends graphs I've posted, I'm also including a chart that fellow Amazontard u/slocs1 used in his EPS post. 

&#x200B;

TABLE 1

https://preview.redd.it/9i90ampipkb61.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fa531224626dabfcf0a80ff6606aedc695099b8

TABLE 2 shows trending results for Q2 Amazon google trends. The last big ride for Amazon was for q2 (april-june 2020). Google trends justified Q2's pop as average google interest was well over 80 and mostly in the 90s.

&#x200B;

TABLE 2 

[2020 Q2 amazon google trends ](https://preview.redd.it/r2s8ec4vekb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=59380e74bc0f0bca95f145e015aceb575317dc83)

&#x200B;

Q4 2019 ER had an 8% pop day of earnings release. Mostly in 50s and 60s interest, plus holiday pop, then averaged out at 75 interest. Trends showed in TABLE 3:

TABLE 3

[2019 Q4 amazon google trends ](https://preview.redd.it/ywz1etq9fkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0805354ecd48509438c5ff78d272c0a20e6760b)

2020 Q4  shows very similar interest patterns to previous years. The dip in interest is from the election, not sure what that mid October pop in interest was. The general interest is higher than 2019.

&#x200B;

TABLE 4

[2020 Q4 amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/bv6kuc6hjkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=23f61372729937b710a393e282430613d2627ed7)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TABLE 5 shows entire 2019-2020 google trends. Again that Q2 growth in interest (may) directly correlates to stock's growth during Q2 Earnings Release. The holiday season interest was stretched out this year, and shows it was 10 days longer than 2019 Q4, which is promising. 

&#x200B;

TABLE 5

[2019-2020 Amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/3b56dq10kkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=efc1925f3c7310f3b63dc859814e17b287312235)

And here is 5 year google trends. Clearly, massive growth in Q2 this year, but radically declined to the yearly mean for Q3, which is possibly why Q3 ER dropped the underlying stock price, as interest stagnated, although it was still above the previous years interest. 

&#x200B;

TABLE 6

[5 Year Amazon google trends](https://preview.redd.it/r5hjpvq4nkb61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=623a3375c36d2baec87a5f66b71679134a49d42d)

&#x200B;

Although Google Trends isn't taking into account all of the industries AMZN is dipping it's pen into (i.e. AWS). I do think it's compelling all the same. I will say that I wish I saw more of a drastic change in Q4 google trends to be more confident my calls will print. Please, give me feedback and advice as my calls are bleeding rocket fuel :)

29,$SRNE to the moon (again) üöÄ,47,ky63a8,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky63a8/srne_to_the_moon_again/,20,"First-time poster here, but I've been lurking since about September. Y'all brought me tendies in the form of GME and PLTR plays in the past couple months, so I thought it was my turn to repay the favor with some DD on a company that I haven't seen posted about on here yet. This isn‚Äôt a short-squeeze opportunity or an ARK darling that‚Äôs up 100% in the past year. The play here is Sorrento Therapeutics ($SRNE). SRNE is a biotech company which specializes in researching the use of stem-cells for cancer treatments, as well as non-opiod pain relief treatments. However, if you recognize the name, its more likely due to their developing pipeline of COVID-19 offerings. Since the outbreak began in March, SRNE has applied their resources and existing competencies to developing treatments and testing kits to combat the pandemic. In addition to their ongoing cancer and pain relief projects, they have 11 potential COVID-19 related products in various stages of the pipeline. You can view everything that they are working on here:

[https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/](https://sorrentotherapeutics.com/research/pipeline/)

Essentially, this company is working on projects to combat cancer, the opioid epidemic, and, oh yeah the global pandemic that has dominated the planet for almost a year now. There is massive demand in all of these areas for new solutions, and Sorrento could be one of the organizations that solves part of the problem. 

Needless to say, SRNE has a lot going on in its labs at the moment. However, each one of these projects represents a potential catalyst for the stock price. For example, the stock jumped almost 200% on May 15th when the company announced that one of their antibody treatments was 100% effective in inhibiting the virus in early testing. (I was holding 450 shares @ 3.15 that I had purchased purely out of excitement for their cancer and pain relief work. I was more than happy to dump them at $10.2 during pre-market on May 18th üòå)

[https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability](https://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sti-1499-potent-anti-sars-cov-2-antibody-demonstrates-ability)

Then in August, the share price climbed to a peak of $20, apparently on pure speculation. These two examples demonstrate that this stock has a ton of interest in any news or releases on the COVID front, which arguably isn‚Äôt even its main business. The share price has been volatile since August, moving within the $5-12 range over the past 5 months.

**The reason I am writing this post now** is because the stock is up about 20% today, again with no news as of this posting. On December 22nd, the company filed an application for an Emergency Use Authorization for their rapid-test product with the FDA. This is where I think the real money is there to be made. They missed the boat on the vaccine race, but there is still a huge need for improved testing, which in the past has been inefficient and inaccurate. SRNE‚Äôs COVI-STIX can reportedly deliver results in 2-15 minutes. With widespread availability of this testing, we could even get back to sporting events and concerts, as testing could be done quickly at the gates of the arena, and any positive cases would be turned away and refunded. SRNE is also working on a rapid spit-test, which would eliminate the need to have a q-tip rammed into your brain.

News on the potential approval of COVI-STIX is imminent, which could further send the stock price higher in the short-term. 20% would only be the first step on this moon mission, as no real news has even been released yet. It's also possible that the jump we saw today could be pure speculation and the price will fall back into the $7-8 range next week and stay there until actual news is released. I'm not saying buy or don't buy right now, but I wanted to get this DD out here before the stock really moons. Just wanted to give everyone a chance to read into this company over the long weekend.

Regardless of this short-term spike, the play here is the sheer number of possible catalysts in their pipeline at the moment. The stock currently trades at a $2.6B market cap, which leaves room for a huge move upwards. The company has increased their cash while lowering debt in the last year, meaning they should be in no danger of going under in the near term. They generated $28M in revenue in the first 9 months of 2020 from their one existing product, and this revenue could double if they get any of their new products approved.

SRNE closed at $9.50 today, but the **average 1-yr estimate on this company is $25**, which in my view is completely attainable if any of their products attain FDA approval and make it to the market.

If you're looking for any other reasons to get on the SRNE train, the company has a CEO in Dr. Henry Ji who publicly hates shorts as much as we all do.

*""I am giving them a fair warning shot. Just cover yourself, don't ruin your family,"" Ji said of short sellers who he says are trying to manipulate Sorrento's stock.*

(Seriously, with the amount of hype around this stock, it takes almost nothing to move it double-digit percentage points)

Even after this declaration back in August, there are still 68M shares sold short as of 12/31/20. It's not GME level short interest, but it would accelerate the rockets if any big approval news is released.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/srne/short-interest)

I'm not as experienced with options trading as most of you are, but if you want to buy calls I would buy them at least a few months out. The news that could send this stock up 100% is likely imminent, but it will be impossible to predict its timing since we are dealing with FDA approval here. It could be next week, it could be in March. My guess is as good as yours. I wouldn't buy any weeklies or FD's and expect to hit it big. If you like what you read here, take some of your GME profits and buy a few shares and hold on till this baby hits $20+

As always, do your own research into the stock before throwing your money at it.

**Positions:** Too dumb for options so I'm holding 500 boomer shares at $7.21.

**TLDR:** Biotech company with over a dozen potential COVID/Cancer/Pain Relief products in various stages of FDA approval process. Potential EUA approval for rapid COVID testing product sometime in the next month = üöÄ. CEO hates shorts. Buy shares or longer-term options to ensure that you are holding when any news hits.

* Board members that are likely on their way out are selling shares
* An additional board member's (Kurt Wolf's)  fund sold a bunch of shares the other day to align with their concentration guidelines for individual stock positions. Essentially the price went up too much and the position got too big as a percent of total assets so they sold some.
* Per the recent agreement Ryan Cohen signed with the company he is not allowed to own more than a 19.9% steak. As of the most recent filing he only owns 12.9%
* Form 4 (change in ownership over 10% and transactions by insiders) must be filed within 2 business days (Ryan Cohen and new board member are subject to this one)
* Forms 13-D (ownership over 5%) & Form 3 (new steaks over 10% and initial statements by insiders) must be filed within 10 days (Other large buyers are subject to form 13-D and the new board members are subject to form 3)

The Important Part:

Because we didn't have a Form 4 filed today by Ryan Cohen the massive move Wednesday was not fueled by him picking up an additional 7%. This means he likely still has dry powder to buy more stock if he wants it. Additionally no forms 13-D or 3 means that the new directors may not have picked up shares yet either (if they want them).

Alright, shut the fuck up about GME for a second and Im gonna make you money. y'all heard alot about PLUG from a few places as of late. Yes, it has exploded 135% in the last month alone but it isn't over. Right now, the sentiment is bearish and I agree in the short term, but long term PLUG is only going to keep growing. There are a few key points I want to highlight.

PLUG is single-highhandedly the largest hydrogen-fuel-cell titan in the industry. 20 years of industry under its belt, it now services Amazon with 40,000 active forklifts and Walmart uses roughly 10,000 active vehicles. Now, they are partnering with two more titans. Renault and SK Group. The French and South Korean markets respectively. First, Renault. Renault is well established in France, and is backed by the government itself. The deal with Renault is HUGE for plug in the European market. **The two plan to establish an innovation center for development of fuel cell technology in LCV vehicles** ***for*** **future Renault platforms. Initially, heavy vans and utility. They plan on combining manufacturing with Renault, establishing a vertically integrated fuel cell stack system and a manufacturing center in France. Expansion of refueling systems to accommodate the new market. The deal will only accelerate in the future as Renault plans to adopt Plug Power technology in commercial fleets.** Why is Renault Interested? Well, the EU announced a plan calling for Europe to have at least six gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2024 (A critical period for PLUG for a few more reasons) and the production of up to 1 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen. Doable, sure, but the bigger picture is this:

This is almost exactly how the rise of the solar industry happened. EU plans into the future. The European Union unveiled a plan this month to invest hundreds of billions of euros in technologies enabling it to get a substantial share of its energy from hydrogen by 2050. This is potentially **insane**.

([https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen\_strategy.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen_strategy.pdf))

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second group. SK Group is planning to invest 1.5 billion USD in an intention to form a joint venture next year. The goal is to provide South Korea (and later a possibility of the larger Asian Market) hydrogen fuel cell systems. Particularly, Infrastructure and electrolyzers (power stations, basically). There is, however, no information if PLUG is planning on directly partnering with any manufacturers in Korea. (I will get to this later). Why is SK Group interested in Plug? Plans call to build a liquid hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 30,000 tons in Incheon in **2023**, to be scaled up to 280,000 tons in **2025**. The South Korean government's commitment to shift the to Hydrogen with 729 Million dollars this year. A 30% increase from last year.

Sweet summer child..

Hydrogen fuel is going to be big in the automotive scene. Yes, Papa Musk hates it, so fucking what? keep buying one year out calls @ 50% OTM and tell Musk to fuck off with how much bank you're going to make.

GM may have made a statement that they are going for ALL hydrogen back in 2017, but they have since rescinded that statement. Their Hydrogen plan still remains though, Fuel-cell power-trains will be used in military and commercial vehicles. ([https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en](https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en))

Honda is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology. The Honda Clarity. They plan on expanding on the line greatly as they seem to be extremely set on becoming green.

Hyundai is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology, the Hyundai Nexo. **Hyundai Motor Group and its suppliers plan to spend of 7.6 trillion won (US$6.7 billion) through 2030 to raise production of fuel cells by more than 200-fold as the South Korean automaker targets to become a key player in the new-energy vehicle technology.**

So much money is flowing into Hydrogen fuel cell technology, why is noone capitalizing on it?

The play: Wait for volatility to die down, PLUG has had a massive run up. Truly tremendous, and I'm glad to have been in PLUG for a long while. The hype is almost certainly blown up, and general market attitude is that it is a sell which I agree with.

34,Walgreens Vaccine Distribution,14,ky2ca6,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky2ca6/walgreens_vaccine_distribution/,15,"With the COVID vaccine being distributed more and more, we need to find out who will directly benefit from the distribution. As you can tell by the title I believe that company is WBA. WBA has been severely undervalued for the past year and has just started to rise significantly. 

Some of the factors that have allowed the stock to increase has been a sale of the overseas distribution business. This allows more focus on the growing ecommerce business and the task of employing MDs at 600+ locations.

But as you guessed it, that stuff is already priced in. So what's the thing that is currently being undervalued? or not being taken in account? Yes Walgreens vaccine distribution. Already Walgreens has started the process of distributing the vaccine. 

However Walgreens will not profit for the distribution directly. Meaning that they wont be paid large sums of money from the government to vaccinate the public. BUT they will benefit from the increased foot traffic in their stores when the community has to come in for **2** doses. 

In an earnings call on Jan 7th management downplayed the benefits from distributing the vaccine. Saying that the benefit of ""COVID vaccines is likely to be offset by COVID headwind"". Spoiler alert! : Covid headwinds have been happening since March. How dare you tell your telling your shareholders that the benefit of distributing the vaccine is nil. 

This is why I think that the company is intentionally downplaying the benefits of distribution in order to post a next quarter earnings beat. 

Barclays analyst Steven Valiquette states: ""the  Covid-19 vaccine  benefit  will  likely  be quite material on the core retail pharmacy side as it is largely expected to offset most of the \~$200  mln Covid/flu headwinds the  company expects in  F2Q21.""

The theory of management downplaying the distribution in order to beat estimates is strengthened when you look at CEO Stefano Pessina. Over the summer he planned to step down, which makes sense because the man is 79. But also if you were finally ready for retirement, wouldn't you want a little cash to throw around? The bulk of Stefano's $8.5 billion dollar fortune is purely WBA stock. So is it crazy to think that he could use a manufactured earnings beat to give one last pump to the stock?

And that's where us autist come in. If Stefano is going to profit off this, so will we.

Of course gme will hit $500/share end of year, but for all other semi-retarded autist, lemme tell you why you should be buying $bbby right now before close. 

- Very well regarded Mark Tritton (former Target CMO) became a CEO just over a year ago. He‚Äôs the only the 3rd CEO and 1st outsider in the company‚Äôs history who‚Äôs very optimistic about a turnaround

- they‚Äôve sold non-core assets and expect to raise additional $350mm-$450mm in cash from non-core that will be pushed towards digital sales

- Digital Comps up 94% YoY. Penetration online continues to grow drastically with a 31% annual growth rate

- More digital means wider margins. Gross Margins increased from 32.2% to 35.4% which simply means they make 3% more on every sale which is huge. 

- They‚Äôve increased the planned share buy-back from $675mm to $825mm in the next 3 years. That‚Äôs 1/3 of the fucking float which signals the confidence of the management 

- Haters might point Net income was negative. True, but it was mainly due to $2.469 billion NON recurring  restructuring cost. If we omit that cost, the net income over the past three years is +$500mm. 

- EV/EBITDA is 10.01 vs conservative 12.7 industry average at the time of this post. So that alone should put us at a fair value of $35/share today. Based on forward EBITDA for 2021, that‚Äôs $39/share in the next 12 months. And that‚Äôs not accounting for share buyback.


Sounds good right. But wait, there‚Äôs more

This play is dirt cheap with little downside, and yet to recover to pre-COVID highs, even with the explosion in fiber and 5G. Lumen currently sits around $10, pre-COVID it was around $15, but it can run so much further. Simplywall.st has a price target of $45, I would say that‚Äôs crazy but with GameStops value correction lately, who knows lol

Lumen has a big competitive advantage thanks to century link, and that‚Äôs its 450,000 mile fiber network. That places it in the top 2 in the US. With fiber and 5G becoming more mainstream, expect this stock to climb.  It‚Äôs been shifting it‚Äôs business away from the dying business model of Century Link, working on a rebrand, paying off debt, and have had good earnings. 

As lumen moves further from century links business and starts benefiting from its Level 3 acquisition which will boost profits and cashflow for years, I don‚Äôt see this going any lower anytime soon.

I am also an engineer at an OEM. IoT  has been getting more popular lately but BB isn't doing anything special  here. Companies like TopCon (Tractors/Combines), Rexroth (Mobile  Equipment), IFM (Industrial), ect. are way ahead of the game here with  this tech and have been doing it a lot longer. BB says they have 63% of  the market on EV's? How many companies actually make EV's? Not many. If I  was an automaker I'd be looking to adjacent industries for an already  existing tech to use.

This  is what TESLA did by using the RC controller from Rexroth, which is  mainly a mobile hydraulics supplier (i.e. construction equipment). Every TESLA car has one of these controllers under their hood. 

TopCon  has 15 years in this IoT space and self driving tractors all use this  technology. They are also thinking about breaking into the automotive  field as well.

If you're an  engineer looking into IoT, you've probably heard of IFM as well. These  guys are like the Cadillac of IoT/Touchscreen displays. Incredibly smart  engineers work here and all their products are made with a focus on  data security. I've probably sat down in a dozen or so meetings with  various companies about IoT. Most are generic bland dashboards and use  the same hardware. So from an OEM standpoint, how do I choose which one  to use? Well who has the most value-add in this space, in terms of  cooperation/engineering support for integrating their tech into our  equipment? IFM is leagues above these other companies in this instance.  Most of the companies out there treat IoT like it's a side hustle but  it's going to be huge going forward no doubt.

Tldr;  BB will probably get squeezed out of this space like they did in the  phone industry because major players are ahead of the game compared to  them. Partnered with AWS? Oh boy! Better watch out! News flash, the  companies listed above all use either AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for  IoT data already.",1610729877.0

To understand heat, you have to understand gp96. The cellular heat shock protein gp96 is very versatile molecule. It has long been known for its ability to induce immunity against antigens from the cell from which it came.

Gp96 serves as a:

¬∑ Potent mucosal immune memory inducer

¬∑ It Chaperones antigens (pathogens or tumor) to the immune system

¬∑ Activates B cell response and drives antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell activation

Essentially, the gp96 heat shock protein is a warning system developed by humans over hundreds of millions of years. It is released into the cell upon cell death and warns the body of its containing antigens. It has a wide range of applications for infectious diseases & different types of cancer.

**Upcoming Catalysts**

**1.**  **HS-110**

Phase 2 completion of its Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell therapy treatment, HS-110.

HS-110 is Heat‚Äôs first biologic product candidate in a series of proprietary¬†*ImPACT*¬Æ based immunotherapies designed to stimulate a patient‚Äôs own T-cells to destroy cancer.

From the company website:

¬∑ Using our gp96 platform, the company has developed HS-110 as a treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

¬∑ HS-110 is an off-the-shelf cell-based therapy. Our scientists have genetically engineered HS-110 to secrete a wide range of cancer testis antigens chaperoned by gp96 proteins.

¬∑ In clinical trials, HS-110 demonstrated a broad activation of T-cell mediated immune response in cancer patients.

¬∑ Our HS-110 Phase 2, multicenter clinical trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of HS-110 in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb‚Äôs checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab (Opdivo¬Æ) or Merck‚Äôs checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (Keytruda¬Æ). The enrollment for this trial has completed with approximately 120 patients.

**Keytruda**  
**Company**: Merck & Co.  
**Used for**: Melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, large B-cell lymphoma, urothelial carcinoma, microsatellite instability-high cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer,¬†cervical cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma  
**2019 sales**: $11.1 billion

**Opdivo**  
**Company**: Bristol Myers Squibb  
**2019 sales**: $8.06 billion  
**Projected 2026 sales**: $11.62 billion  
**Projected CAGR**: +5%  
**Used for**: melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer

As you can see, HS-110 is being used in combination with Keytruda and Opdivo which are already the two best in class therapies available. They make over 20 Billion combined in revenue per year. Heat has reported in its midpoint data (posted on the company investor slide deck on their website), a significantly better survival rate when using either of these with HS-110. They also stated they are seeking a ‚ÄúPotential strategy to accelerate clinical development‚Äù. Given the data, it could be accepted under FDA‚Äôs ‚Äúbreakthrough therapy‚Äù designation for FDA fast tracking. Regardless, if this gets to phase 3, its almost a certainty it will be acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb or Merck for the IP rights.

The estimated preliminary completion date for HS-110 phase 2 was December 2020, expecting updates most likely this quarter, at the latest by the end of the first half of this year.

**2.**  **HS-130**

A cell therapy treatment for advanced solid tumour patients

Summary: This is an open-label, non-controlled, first-in-human Phase I study of HS-130 and HS-110 in patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to, or ineligible for, Standard of Care.

Seven dose levels will be explored in escalating doses. For each dose level, patients will receive combination HS-130 and HS-110 via intradermal injections once every 14 days. The Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) window of observation will include the first 28 days of treatment. In the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, patients will continue to receive combination treatment every two weeks until disease progression, death, patient's withdrawal of consent, Investigator decision to discontinue treatment, or intolerable toxicity, whichever occurs first.

The estimated preliminary completion date for HS-130 phase 1 was November 2020, expecting updates most likely this quarter.

**3.**  **COVID-19 Vaccine**

Funny enough, with the stimulus talks going as poorly as they were throughout the second half of 2020, I thought the covid vax was off the table.

Now, Biden‚Äôs new 1.9 T stimulus is adding 160 Billion for testing and new vaccine development.

The vaccine‚Äôs out now are a bandaid. They only provide temporary immunity(could be less than a year). Heat Biologics‚Äô COVID-19 vaccine program focuses on engineering multiple protein regions of the virus into their gp96 platform. Such design has the potential of generating long-term immune responses and may confer immunity to different coronaviruses. So, it can give long term cellular induced immunity and protect against mutations. Do some research on Covid-19 and T cells (As mentioned at the start, one of GP96‚Äôs main effects is activation of CD4 and CD8 killer t cells).

Heat‚Äôs vaccine is targeted on the niche market of the most at risk populations. It‚Äôs the only company solely focusing on this market from my experience.

‚ÄúOur COVID-19 vaccine is being designed to generate T-cells to support those who are most at risk and need an extra immune boost, including the elderly and those with co-morbidities.‚Äù

Heat stated they don‚Äôt want to use any of their own capital on this and will solely advance the program if they receive funding. With the importance being placed on wave 2 vaccines, this could receive funding which boosted a lot of companies values in the summer during the big funding round.

**HS-110 PV Model**

Expected value breakdown of HS-110. I learned this modelling technique from a professor I had that was a preclinical bio VC. It‚Äôs a present value market estimation technique that definitely requires estimation and has subjective elements, but is the best way there is to model these products.

To give a brief background of the model, biotechs are valued based on the aggregated potential market value of each of the products in their pipeline discounted by the probability it makes it through each of the 3 phases.

For example, the empirical probability used in valuation models that a company makes it though phase 2 is 37% and that it makes it through phase 3 are about 50%.

So with that being said, ‚ÄúThe global non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapeutics market size was valued at USD 16,011.7 Million in 2018 and is projected to reach USD 43,713.1 Million by the end of 2026, exhibiting a CAGR of 13.4% in the forecast period (2019-2026).‚Äù

Say HS-110 is going into market in 2022, the expected value of the market is expected to be 26B based on its CAGR. So in a 26B target market that HTBX will be disrupting we can say it will VERY conservatively give a 2B increase to its value(big estimation here but bear with me). Then discounting that by 50% (phase 3 completion probability) and another 37.6% (for phase 2 completion probability) means just HS-110 is conservatively worth 376M to Heat in 2022. Discounting 2 years at the CAGR of the industry growth, HS-110 is worth about 292M (12.79$/share) to Heat right now. Adding the current cash/equivalents on hand of 113M to that, HTBX‚Äôs current SP would be 17.74(a 180% premium above the current SP of 6.34).

**Why is the stock price so undervalued right now?**

The company pumped out a 150M shelf and diluted since a massive pump in July to the covid sector. It created a lot of bagholders. In December a 7-1 reverse split was preemptively carried out the day after it was announced. For months Sabby management was taking huge short positions causing daily 30-40% avg short interest. Sabby announced they closed all positions at HTBX a few weeks ago. Another 250M shelf offering is open, and isn‚Äôt intended to be used until needed.

All of this was a necessary evil for funding and value creation. The CEO Jeff wolf has an experience of creating value for companies then selling them for huge premiums. During the sector pump in the summer other execs sold their shares on the pumps, Jeff, and the other Heat execs have not disposed of any shares. Jeff actually received in late July 2M options for heat stock at split adjusted $14.49/share. He‚Äôs continued to increase his stake since. A new CFO was hired last week with two incentive clauses, he‚Äôll get a bonus if heat closes above a 500M market cap for 15 days straight or is acquired for 125% premium or more.

I still urge you to do more DD on the company, there‚Äôs a lot more to discover, but I truly believe this could be a massive runner over the coming weeks, and especially by the end of the quarter/first half of the year as it completes its upcoming catalysts. I‚Äôve never been more confident on a company being undervalued.",1610840744.0

I saw this on one of the other forums about a big investment made by a billionaire hedge fund manager last year:

From Tonight's SEC 10k: Brent Atwood NOW listed as a $SOAN Insider - He has bought 25.2 MILLION shares on the open market. Who is Brent Atwood? Featured Investor on IMBD; https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7214210/bio Worth Billions and Holds the Guinness Record for Most gains; ""In August of 2016, Brent Atwood via eQuine Holdings, LLC submitted his trading returns to the Guinness Book of World Records"" FUN FACT: In 2019 the Same Brent Atwood Bought $300,000 shares of $SOAN and ran it himself multi cent.

Some comments mention waiting for an FDA approval. This could be related to some of the patents they own, possibly related to the work they are doing on Multiple Sclerosis. Maybe this is why there is an increase in volume lately.

Anyway, could be one to keep on the radar this week. Might possibly be an early play for some. I managed to grab a bag on friday, eyeing up a mid to long term hold while it gains momentum.

50,Capitalize on the EV revolution the smart way. Why European Metals (ERPNF/EMHLF) is the ideal speculation for the future of battery technology.,6,kytqs2,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kytqs2/capitalize_on_the_ev_revolution_the_smart_way_why/,5,"[European Metals](https://www.europeanmet.com/) is lithium exploration and development company. They trade on US markets under the ticker ERPNF and EMHLF. ERPNF is their Nasdaq International ticker. If you're exclusively on Robinhood, this OTC stock is unavailable to you. 

**What Do They Do:** They operate the Cinovec hard rock lithium resource, which is the largest in all of Europe, and one of the largest on the planet. 

**Where Do They Do It:** The resource is located [100 km NW of Prague](https://www.europeanmet.com/cinovec-lithium-tin-project/#:~:text=Cinovec%20hosts%20a%20globally%20significant,and%20262%2C600t%20of%20tin.). This is critical because it places them in the heart of Europe, and within close proximity to major EV auto manufacturers, battery manufacturers, and chemical plants, such as Tesla, Porche, Samsung, LG, BASF and VW. 

**How Good Is The Resource:** Significantly good! EMH plans to supply a minimum 15,267 tpa lithium hydroxide or 22,500 tpa lithium carbonate into the European battery market. 

> ""Cinovec is an historic mine incorporating a significant undeveloped lithium-tin resource with by-product potential including tungsten, rubidium, scandium, niobium and tantalum and potash. Cinovec hosts a globally significant hard rock lithium deposit with a total Indicated Mineral Resource of 372.4Mt @ 0.4% Li2O and 0.04% Sn and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 323.5Mt @ 0.39% Li2O and 0.04% Sn containing a combined 7.18 million tonnes Lithium Carbonate Equivalent and 262,600t of tin. This makes Cinovec the largest lithium deposit in Europe, the fourth largest non-brine deposit in the world and a globally significant tin resource.""

**Can They Get It Done:** Absolutely. The operation is fully funded, the resources are present, and the demand is high. They have no real obstacles other than time. 

**Is The Timing Correct:** Yes. ERPNF currently trades around $1/share. This company is still in the early stages, and trades OTC, so it is in pre-hype form. The story, however, is flawless. It's only a matter of time before they see similar gains as Piedmont. 

**Why Am I So Bullish:** EV and battery technology is still in its nascent stages, and is clearly the future for the planet. From prototyping to development, to manufacturing, there are almost countless companies racing against each other, and they all require lithium to complete their work. Even companies like Sony are developing EVs, and it's developing it in Europe. In fact, all of Europe is rapidly pushing to replace current automobiles with EVs. It is the most favorable location for a lithium resource. 

**Is There Any Way To Predict Their Future:** There certainly is! Look at their competitor in the United States, Piedmont Lithium ($PLL), which is located in North Carolina. In September, they announced a partnership with Tesla to supply lithium hydroxide, and **the stock ran from $6 to $42**. I expect the same reaction as EMH completes similar partnerships. 

**Position:** 40,000 shares ERPNF

**TL:DR;** European Metals (ERPNF) operates an enormous lithium deposit. Batteries require lithium. European Metals is located directly in the middle of major EV, battery, and chemical manufacturing companies. It's competitor increased over 7x after announcing their first major partnership.",1610838622.0

The financials look promising and they are working on new products. Currently trading at around 0.05$. The CNN forecast is 4$\[1\], but \~0.20$ is more realistic in the short term IMO.

**Profile**

Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company that is developing a pipeline of proprietary pharmacological abuse-deterrent opioid products as well as niche generic products. Elite specializes in oral sustained and controlled release drug products that have high barriers to entry. Elite owns generic products that have been licensed to TAGI Pharma and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, Inc., USA.

Elite currently has twelve approved generic products, three generic products filed with the FDA, two approved generic products pending manufacturing site transfer, and an NDA filed for SequestOx‚Ñ¢.

**Pros**

2020 has been a good year for them as they more than doubled their revenue. And it has been profitable for the past few quarters due to its shift to ADHD generics\[2\]. 

The other thing worth noting is the CEO owns 24% of shares \[3\].

Their balance sheet looks good, saying they have 57% debt to asset ratio. 

They are actively developing new products, they have hired a new Vice President of Scientific Affairs to oversee the development of new products. \[4\]

**Cons**

Small market cap,

No upcoming catalyst, the earning for Q4 will be out on Feb 8.

There are 1 billion outstanding shares, so they will probably do a reverse split unless the company buys back most of the shares

Huge catalysts coming soon.,26,kymmf6,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kymmf6/great_dd_on_xxii_plant_biotech_company_working/,46,"XXII is a plant biotechnology company working primarily with tobacco and hemp/cannabis.

""Our primary mission in hemp/cannabis is to develop proprietary hemp/cannabis plants with valuable cannabinoid profiles and agronomic traits and to commercialize those plants through a synergistic portfolio of strategic partnerships in the hemp/cannabis industry.""

XXII can achieve these things through methods mentioned in their patents.

The idea behind their low-nicotine tobacco is VLN (Very Low Nicotine) cigarettes. [22nd Century has 18 publishes clinical studies](https://www.xxiicentury.com/vln-clinical-studies/published-clinical-studies-on-very-low-nicotine-content-vlnc-cigarettes), with another [27 clinical studies currently ongoing](https://www.xxiicentury.com/vln-clinical-studies/on-going-clinical-studies-on-very-low-nicotine-content-vlnc-cigarettes), (Heavily funded by the National Institute of Health, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the FDA.) that show that using [VLN cigarettes lead to decreased nicotine consumption](https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/24/6/536), [decreased cigarettes smoked over time and increased quit attempts](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1502403). [Quit rates while using VLN + NRTs (Nicotine replacement therapies) were higher than when using NRTs alone.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22594651/) [Withdrawals were less severe using VLN than using other NRTs.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23603206/)

On top of this, studies were done to measure compensatory use in response to using VLN, and they show that [compensatory smoking does not occur](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6939759/), even in [vulnerable populations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27714427/). Because cigarettes smoked per day decreases when using VLN, [exposure to toxicants outside of just nicotine will also occur](https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/25/7/1125.abstract).

There is a rigorous process to put tobacco products on the market. First there is the PMTA (Pre market tobacco product application) which allows a company to put it‚Äôs products on the market. XXII received this approval in December 2019. They have not brought the product to market just yet because they want to make sure it can be labelled appropriately so consumers know what makes it different.

Then there is the MRTP (Modified risk tobacco product). This essentially allows the company to make specific claims in regards to modified risk/exposure from using their products. XXII is seeking a MODIFIED EXPOSURE claim to put on the packaging. They want to label the packaging to say that VLN has 95% less nicotine than leading brands and helps reduce nicotine consumption.

Mish, the CEO of XXII, has been saying since about September that they have been in close contact with the FDA and feel that it is a matter of WHEN, not if, MRTP approval happens. They were expecting it in Q4-2020, but that did not happen. No new timelines has been announced.

Soon after saying this, [Mish proceeded to purchase 100,000 shares of XXII](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/22nd-century-group-inc-xxii-201502687.html).

[Mish continues to say that even a small percent of the market (.25%) would be enough to drive stock price up to $10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KVn8Lgf0Kw&ab_channel=CoreyCivin). According to CDC and the WHO, there are over 1 billion smokers in the world. Over 34 million in the US. 2/3 of Adult smokers want to quit, and 1/2 of adult smokers made an attempt to quit in the past year. Less than 10% of smokers successfully quit.

Not only this, but according to a perception study done by XXII, 9% of participants DEFINITELY would use VLN. 16% are very likely to use. 34% are somewhat likely to use.

https://preview.redd.it/qbbw409y5qb61.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=29149dc518a92a7b2d75b095511711c266815c5b

XXII has said previously that they currently have the ability to supply 1% of the smoker population, increased to 2-3% with minimal investments. Last week, [XXII put out an update that they are SIGNIFICANTLY increasing their VLN crop growing program in support of anticipated demand.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/22nd-century-group-expands-vln-170000164.html)

They've also said they have been in talks with companies who are very excited to feature the first and only MRTP approved combustible product, and that they will have a rollout and be on shelves within 90 days of MRTP approval. And they said they are not giving out raises or promotions until MRTP approval is received. This was 5-6 months ago, too.

Mish described this MRTP approval as a home run scenario which I think we can all agree he is right. However there is also a GRAND SLAM scenario.

The FDA and various other groups have been working for years to limit the nicotine content in tobacco. [In 2017 the FDA created a comprehensive plan for tobacco which included limiting nicotine content in cigarettes to non-addictive levels.](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/fdas-comprehensive-plan-tobacco-and-nicotine-regulation) Then in 2018 they released an article titled [""How Could Lowering Nicotine Levels in Cigarettes Change the Future of Public Health? ""](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/public-health-education/how-could-lowering-nicotine-levels-cigarettes-change-future-public-health).

The same year, the NEJM published this report titled [""Potential Public Health Effects of Reducing Nicotine Levels in Cigarettes in the United States""](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1714617) indicating that such a standard could save millions of lives in the US alone. Considering there are only 34 million current smokers in the US, that seems HUGE. Imagine for the rest of the 966 million+ smokers in the world.

[Two days after Pallone's tweet, this article came out about nicotine mandate talks being resumed.](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/27/house-tobacco-bill-revives-talk-of-nicotine-limits-117908)

Xavier becerra and Kamala Harris are obviously close to Biden, but so is [David Kessler who has vocally supported a nicotine mandate since 2010.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/former-fda-commissioner-david-kessler-calls-on-fda-to-mandate-reduction-in-nicotine-levels-in-cigarettes-96497194.html)

This mandate would heavily benefit XXII. They are the only company in the world that can produce tobacco with virtually no nicotine. Other companies have attempted to create low nicotine cigarettes by extracting the nicotine from regular tobacco in a variety of methods, but all of these methods influence the feel, flavor, and smell of the tobacco going into the cigarette, and it shows. [See Philip Morris's 'Next' cigarette.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_(cigarette))

Given this, if a mandate goes into effect, big tobacco has a couple choices. Find some alternative method of extracting nicotine that somehow doesn't fuck up the plant (yet to be found and proven), They could spend decades working on science that xxii has already figured out and patented (obviously the worst choice), or they can work with xxii to produce their tobacco. XXII has already said that they are open to licensing with all tobacco companies.

There is also substantial room for growth into different industries for tobacco -

https://preview.redd.it/szmj7kp27qb61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3bf9e757e38eabe752944de6e4f8184dd33ef82

On the cannabis side, xxii is creating proprietary plant lines with essentially customizable amounts of specific cannabinoids and terpenes. With Democratic control, we are expecting to see decriminalization for sure. But now that Dems also have the senate we can expect to see cannabis removed as a schedule 1 drug, opening it up to funding for research purposes. Any of this research is poised to benefit XXII heavily as they have control to customize plant lines for various purposes.

XXII also is waiting to announce a third plant franchise until they have established the IP, but it should be soon.

To sum up the expected catalysts -

1. MRTP approval - ""WHEN NOT IF""...""MATTER OF MONTHS"" from CEO back in Sep-Nov 2020
2. Subsequent launch of product on shelves within 90 days.
3. FDA announcement on nicotine mandate.
4. Cannabis announcements
5. 3rd Plant Franchise.

I think the writing is on the wall here. I'm not going to go into any more details here, but if you have any questions feel free to throw them out.

**contracts**

* **government contracts** In September 2020, Mission Ready announced that, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Unifire, Inc., the Company was awarded a total of 7 government contracts ‚Äì for personal protective equipment consisting of disposable level 2 and level 3 isolation gowns (the ‚ÄúIsolation Gowns‚Äù) ‚Äì with an estimated value of $127,878,307 and a maximum value of $435,723,020 (the ‚ÄúC&T Contracts‚Äù) to be fulfilled over a 12-month period.

* **CAD $24 Million FEMA Contract Award**

In May 2020, the Company announced that, further to its news release dated April 28, 2020, the Company had received a CAD $24,000,000 (twenty-four million) contract award (‚ÄúContract Award‚Äù) from the US Department of Homeland Security (‚ÄúDHS‚Äù) Federal Emergency Management Agency (‚ÄúFEMA‚Äù) for the provision of personal protective equipment (‚ÄúPPE‚Äù) to be delivered between May 12, 2020 and September 30, 2020.

Things to Consider (not from me, but this is coming from a smart poster on CEO he sums up pretty much everything that's going on right now.)

* The court case hasn't been updated since November 20th. (Perhaps a mutual agreement considering that the ceiling for SOE is being raised to 8B)
* The $350M is yet to be awarded. The National Emergency Stockpile is seriously lacking PPE. USA set a record in most Covid deaths just this week. PPE is badly needed. Nursing homes are lacking staff, not only in USA but all over the world.
* The 8B bridge contract is to be awarded in January 2021. It will consists of the 2 new SOE players and hopefully Unifire/Quantico in the mix. Unifire has really improved the relationship with the DLA in the last 6 months, it appears. In terms of contract values awarded in 2020, Federal Resources was number 1, Atlantic Diving Supply was number 2 and Unifire 3. Big growth trajectory.
* What is going on with the investor deck for MRS? It was taken down late October and nowhere to be seen. I am thinking we see it early January perhaps along with a new site.
* Company mentioned that they may upgrade to OTCQB but it is very likely they just directly to OTCQX which they qualify for. Buck did mention underpromise and overdeliver, unlike Jeff's mantra, overpromise, underdeliver.
* Bratton and Spider Marks on Board of Directors is very telling. Two big names on such a small venture company is definitely an eye raiser.
* Q4 will be the biggest quarter in the company's history and it is ending today. Q4 will have revenues of $38M minimum plus the $50M+ on top of that according to FPDS. Likely Q4 is about 90M surpassing all of revenue up to Q3 of $62M. Gross profit range, 7-8%.
* Protect The Force has nothing to show for all year. The Ballistic Combat Armor industry keeps increasing, projected to be 27B in 2021. The company will truly propel to new heights if they could get a body armor contract.
* Options for the board of directors have been granted. Now we may see the management accelerate considering the incentive is there.
* ITG seems to be our market maker with some big purchases this week. They're there to promote liquidity and it has been apparent lately.
* The total shares outstanding have been reduced from 230M under Jeff to 213M under Buck. The current share structure is 189M with 45M + 20M options belonging to insiders. The majority of holders of MRS have huge positions and are hesitant to let go. This stock may accelerate quickly once the Americans are allowed to buy freely without worrying about selling.

**Financials**

**Results of Operations for the Nine Months** Ended September 30, 2020 The Company‚Äôs gross revenues for the nine months were **$62.44 million,** an **increase of $54.72 million from the $7.72 million realized in the same period in 2019**, a **709%** increase. This is a direct result of the closing of the acquisition of Unifire and reporting the revenues of Unifire from April 2019. The Company recorded a cost of goods sold of $56.90 million for the period ended September 30, 2020 compared to $6.45 million in 2019. The **gross margin was 8.87%** for the period. . The Company derives approximately 97% of its revenues from customers and clients where the end customer is the US Department of Defense, law enforcement or private security

This year PKG is estimated to post around¬†$14 million¬†in revenues and then return to pre-COVID levels next year. With the acquisition expected to close next month, this puts Cerebain Biotech on track to being a revenue leader on the OTC Markets. This also makes shares of CBBT awfully cheap under a penny. In this article, we take a look at the bull case for Cerebain Biotech and why this bull run is just getting started for CBBT.""

""With the acquisition of PKG and the revenues the company brings in, Cerebain Biotech will turn its attention to bringing ALL SEC filings current. Furthermore, we expect CBBT to uplist to a QB or possibly NASDAQ or NYSE once the PKG acquisition is completed.""

59,Entera Bio (ENTX) prior to liftoff üöÄ,9,kyajwj,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kyajwj/entera_bio_entx_prior_to_liftoff/,12,"Entera Bio has slow growing revenue from their recent orphan drug designation of EB612 for hypoparathyroidism. There‚Äôs basically no way that revenue (in the hundreds of thousands) will cover the upcoming expenses in the millions for the clinical trials needed to take their oral osteoporosis drug, EB613, to market. They took the small victory first, and are going for a much bigger prize now.

Enter Dr. Spiros Jamas, the new CEO. This guy knows how to fundraise. I suspected he was chosen specifically for the purpose of striking deals to extend the cash runway past the end of Q2, 2021. Will that fundraising result in dilution? Inevitably it will. So why buy near this all time low before the funds are raised?

The osteoporosis market ($1.4 billion in revenue per year, as of now) is dominated by injections because that‚Äôs the only option. A majority of doctors say they‚Äôd rather prescribe a pill, if it were available for severe cases of osteoporosis. Nobody else is making a pill for osteoporosis, because drug companies get complacent when there isn‚Äôt competition. That means Entera would get 1-3 years as the only osteoporosis pill. Let‚Äôs assume in that time Entera only captures 10% of the market, that‚Äôs $140 million in revenue compared to their current market cap of $27 million. They could double the number of shares and assuming a significantly lower-than-average P/S ratio of 1x, the share price would be $3.37 (almost triple the current price of $1.29). The average P/S ratio for biotech is 5-6x, and 10% market share is pretty conservative for a version of something everyone would prefer.
https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry_valuation_ttm.php?ps&amp;amp;ind=801

So the next question is, does their pill work for osteoporosis? The answer seems to be, yes: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/20/2081190/0/en/Entera-Bio-Ltd-Announces-Interim-Data-From-Phase-2-Clinical-Trial-of-EB613-in-Osteoporosis-and-Second-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html

As long as we don‚Äôt get anything crazy in terms of adverse events in the higher dose test results for the upcoming interim data due sometime in Q1, 2021, their formulation should have a pretty solid regulatory pathway.

I recommend locking in early, and strapping in tight. The low float will probably make ENTX explode when it finally gets on the radar of more analysts. You could easily see double digit share price if we get a nice boost before they need to make any public, or private offerings.

EDIT: Note that Entera‚Äôs drug is geared towards more severe cases of osteoporosis where serious bone mineral density issues occur. There is a pill for less severe cases that have not yet progressed.",1610766220.0

Are OTCs so under-traded that you can find stocks whose assets are worth more than the market cap? 

They also have aprox. 2020 NI of $11.7M making their P/E multiple 2.6x. That‚Äôs it!? How can it be so low? Barrick Gold (a different gold company) trades around 17.3x LTM Net Income. Has anyone else looked into this? This feels like a Ben Graham/Warren Buffet type trade.

 ***$CBWTF*** is a Canadian company which provides packaged goods in the cannabis product market. They specialise in cultivation, development and distribution of cannabis products. They offer a variety of products such as vape pens, vape cartridges, soft chews, pre-rolled cannabis, chocolates, cannabis oil spray and oils drops. This shows they have enough product to be profitable.

News:

Auxly hit record net revenues in Q1 2020 which were an increase by 1,100% from the first quarter in 2019.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/auxly-reports-third-quarter-2020-121300303.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/auxly-reports-third-quarter-2020-121300303.html) 

Auxly‚Äôs Q3 2020 revenue was $13.4 million, which was an 85% increase from Q2 and shows promise for higher revenues for Q4.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kolab-project-launches-232-series-123000096.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kolab-project-launches-232-series-123000096.html)

December 17th Auxly‚Äôs subsidiary company Kolab Project launched their new vape product. Their new vape product is developed using flash-freeze extraction which preserves the natural terpene profile found in the cannabis plant, in addition, this product is biodegradable. The Kolab Project 232 series is the number selling brand in Auxly‚Äôs portfolio and they secured the number one share position in Canada for vape products.

Lastly, A subsidiary of Auxly, KGK Science, received an institutional cannabis research license from Health Canada.

*‚ÄúAs one of the first entities in Canada to receive this expanded licence, KGK will be able to provide its clients increased access to an expansive portfolio of clinical trials in support of the development of safe and effective cannabis products.‚Äù*

**Positives:**

\- There is lots of hype in the cannabis industry due to Biden winning the election

\- People are missing out on stocks such as Tilray and they won‚Äôt want to miss out on a company which has good financials and future in the cannabis industry

\- Best revenue came in during the coronavirus showing the company was stable enough to survive A new product and a huge deal with Canada Health which flew over people's heads

**Negatives:** 

\- Penny stock which could continue to fly under people's radar if not discussed enough and super volatile. Losses up to 20% for a while should be expected

**Technical Analysis:**

&#x200B;

[Sorted in the Daily time frame, we can see the stock is rising in volume and forming new highs with higher lows, which is a positive for a bullish chart. The RSI is starting to go into the overbought region however since we are expecting a pump, it should break the 2nd level of the overbought region. The pump should be happening in January - February time frame.](https://preview.redd.it/whee7wrr2jb61.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=772f7946a7bac3e2230d6b971ade5401995ea4db)

**Price Targets:**

Level 1: $0.48

Level 2: $0.73

Unlikely but most extreme value: $1.14 

**Conclusion:**  I‚Äôm looking to open a position in ***CBWTF*** because of the recent pumps in Cannabis based stocks. With Auxly‚Äôs recent news and extended medical license this stock has potential to be pumped if enough eyes are caught. Do not forget this is a risky investment too because it is a penny stock.  **Please do not take this as financial advice and do your own research before risking any capital.**",1610730418.0

70,MNVN - Possible 100 bagger +,15,kxucsf,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kxucsf/mnvn_possible_100_bagger/,20,"For those fortunate enough to operate in the sub penny world of OTCs, this may be worth a look 

MNVN - (.0002-.0004) has been gaining popularity recently. 

The DD begins with 
CEO - [Dennis Alexander](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-alexander-03301838)

He currently is the CEO for 4 [companies](https://ibb.co/xfzdts3), and the president of a 5th company. 

Below are the listed publically and non-publiclly traded companies in his name:
BSSP (+83%) - .001
EFIR (+100%) .0002
MNVN (+200%) .0004
Bolmerang oil - not public
GLMN- not public

RUMOR 1: There is reason to believe that he will merge these companies, in some capacity, and I personally believe that MNVN will be that company. 

Basis for my speculation: 
MNVN is the most up-to-date stock, in terms of location. 

As part of a quick search on zillow, we can see that the [location of operation](https://ibb.co/ThnMMFc) was bought in [2017](https://ibb.co/r53KdxD) as opposed to the other [location in Arizona ](https://ibb.co/DpckgzB), marked on the 3 other companies he owns, being that the other compmau locations were most recently sold in 1998 (potentially his old house)

To further my point, both EFIR- 1999' and BSSP-2014'  have not been updated (company names have not been updated to reflect the ""new"" owner when purchased in 1999 and 2014 however MNVN is the name reflecting his ownership). This small fact makes it reasonable that he will use MNVN in a merger to tie his pre-existing gas and oil operation together due to this being the most updated company in his arsenal. 

Rumor 2: all 3 companies are not current, therefore, out of the 3 publically traded companies, it is likely to get pink/current with the company most updated and currently being worked on, while arranging the other companies to now be used later in acquisition.


This is mostly speculation however, BSSP (gained 450% within 1 month) has generated positive numbers based on the same speculation with data that is outdated, therefore, MNVN will likely have the same trajectory and become his priority company.

A $10 mil difference with a pro of greater earnings power, operating cost savings, and higher utilization. Pumping with the electric fleet results in lower completion cost due to low fuel cost.

Now with Biden's clean energy plan, fracking won't go away, but he plans to get rid of subsidiaries for fossil fuels and place significant investments in clean energy. This does hurt USWS somewhat, but there is a positive. What does this mean for USWS? Their main goal apparently is to ""foster environmental stewardship in the oil and gas industry by reducing hydraulic fracturing emissions"". Long-term, if USWS can expand their electric fleets, there will be significant cost savings whilst reducing emissions and pollution. If Biden's plan is set, fracking companies will look to stay in the game for as long as they can which means that USWS can step in and provide an efficient and ""environmentally friendly"" solution.

78,Resort Savers (RSSV) starting to move...,9,kxhde6,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kxhde6/resort_savers_rssv_starting_to_move/,11,"Hi all,

Here is some DD on one that most don't talk about that has 10x potential.

**What they do?**  It is a holding company that is going to be changing to a new name at some point called Phoenix Rising Companies.  They domiciled out of Malaysia.  Currently they have 2 subsidiaries:  Teishan Oil and Admall.  The former is most of the revenue up to now.  99% of their oil is sold domestically in China to 2 gasoline operators (large moat).  The revenue in 2019 was around 30 million.  Admall does little revenue around 500-600k per year (I believe).

With this above revenue for the 4 months prior to Covid hitting China it was trading consistently at $1.50+.   Currently, it is trading at:  0.0845c.  That means it has room to move about 20x just to get back to where it was previous if it just does its thing in a normal Chinese domestic economy.

**Catalysts?**  This is the big reason to invest.

1. They have a definitive agreement signed on 2/2020 to purchase Wandi Coal which produces and sells coal in China.  They are clean mined and certified as such in China.  They are worth 1.2 BILLION dollars as an asset.  Yes that is BILLION I said.  They presell their coal so the revenue comes out to about 100+ MILLION a year.  The mine has about 16-17 years of mining left.  All of this has been audited back in ?2018 or so.  The person selling the coal mine sold for all share transaction of 60 million shares of Resort at $1.50.  So he obviously assumes the price of the final stock after acq. is worth at LEAST $1.50 which again is 20x from recent prices.  This deal is done as mentioned as:  DA is signed (which is legally binding), 1/2 the shares have been transferred to the Wandi owner that is owed, and director changes have been made at Wandi already in 12/2020.
2. They also are signing a binding agreement to acquire Tech99.  It is a disinfection company from Sweden I believe.  They are valued I believe at 100million and revenue for 2020 are estimated to be 12-20 million.  This company holds 20 some patients and their investor info. state testing has shown significant adv. of their products over other disinfection agents.  Resort has already set up a company in the U.S. and hired a director to oversee this aspect so the ball is rolling on this one as well.
3. They are in discussion with acquiring another disinfection company as well.  Nothing concrete yet on this front.

**Drawbacks?**

1. They issued new convertible notes in 2020 which is understandable due to the stoppage of revenue when covid hit China.
2. Who knows when they close the above transactions.  Wandi coal was supposed to be done in Q2, then Q3, then Q4.    No sign of it not happening due to the evidence mentioned above.

**Outstanding shares?**  120 million total, BUT 1/ 2 (60mill) of those were issued just to acquire Wandi Coal.  The stock only has 32 million shares floating.  Most of the stock are held by insiders in the company.

**Price?**  Current 0.0845c close of today.  It has run up 30% or so last 2 days so something may be brewing with the above catalyst which my be leaking out now since it has done nothing for about a month or so.

**Conclusion?**  This is a life altering money play.  Won't happen overnight but will happen when the catalysts are met.  On another site one of the posters is in M+A as a profession and hesitantly based on prodding gave out his price targets as anywhere from $4- 8/ share just based on valuations.

Hope this helps and again I am not an advisor and folks should trust no one and do their own DD.

Full disclosure I am invested in he stock for about 1 month or so based on the info. I presented above.

79,$DNN/$DML.TO - The world's lowest cost Uranium mine in the Athabasca Basin,26,kxckyw,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kxckyw/dnndmlto_the_worlds_lowest_cost_uranium_mine_in/,11,"First of all, thank you to everyone on the positive feedback on my first post going over the macro thesis for Uranium. If you have not already read it, please take a look and make sure you do your own due diligence before you decide to buy any individual stocks.

**Macro Thesis:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kwpx24/the\_macro\_business\_case\_for\_uranium/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kwpx24/the_macro_business_case_for_uranium/)

The most popular name I saw mentioned in some of the comments was Dension Mines and given that it is also one of my own picks, I figured I‚Äôd start with this one.

Disclaimer: This is not a pump and dump and I honestly don‚Äôt care about the short term ins and outs. I have been invested for Uranium in a long time and still have a long horizon until I would consider cashing in any of my gains. My goal is to get people bought into the long-term outlook and not the day-days. If you thought the 50% gain URG had in one day is huge then just wait until the fundamentals in this industry start to rip. I‚Äôm a holder of both Denison and URG which have previously been mentioned on this subreddit and am not selling until we see significant movement in the spot price and/or term price.

**Stock:** Denison Mines Corporation  
**Ticker (Share price):** DDN ($0.80 USD), DML.TO ($1.00 CAD)  
**Market Cap:** $685M

**Overview**

Denison is a Uranium junior with assets in the famous Athabasca basin in Northern Saskatchewan. Their flagship asset is the 90% stake that they own in their Wheeler River project which they believe will be one of the uranium mines which will be first to come online in the new cycle. The Wheeler River project boasts some incredibly low OPEX costs and all-in costs for the project. The Wheeler river project contains two extremely high-grade uranium deposits (Phoenix and Gryphon) which combined hold estimated U308 reserves of 109.4M pounds.

**Management**

CEO: David Cates was appointed as CEO of Denison in 2015 and is a director at other Uranium companies such as Goviex and SkyHarbour Resources. I‚Äôm torn on him as CEO. I really like what he is trying to do with ISR mining but at the same time I think he could have had much better timing with some of his previous financing rounds. I think the expensive financing is likely over at this point so his success/failure will likely hinge on whether or not ISR mining becomes successful.

**ISR Mining (IN SITU RECOVERY MINING)**

Part of the sell of Denison is the question as to whether or not they can be successful with their ISR mining methodology in order to realize the low opex and total costs that they have currently laid out. If this were to be built it would be the first ISR mine in Canada to reach the execution phase. 50% of the world‚Äôs Uranium production currently comes from ISR production and for Denison it is now in the testing phase and getting Canadian regulators on board. ISR has been used in the US and around the world.

At a high level, ISR mining involves pumping a solution down into the uranium orebody, dissolving the uranium, and pumping it back up with minimal CAPEX expenditures. Once it is pumped up the Uranium is removed from the pregnant solution and then transported for processing. There are videos online available if you are a geologist at heart.

What Denison is claiming is that they are introducing a ‚Äúcontained‚Äù methodology of ISR mining. What this means is that the solution they pump into the ground to get the Uranium will be contained to prevent the contamination of the surrounding environment. The contamination is usually the biggest issue regulators have with ISR mining. **Denison is essentially proposing a mining methodology that is at the intersect of extremely low capex, extremely environmentally friendly, and extremely large margins.**

**Financials**

As of Q3, Denison has $7M of cash on hand along with $11M of working capital. Their Q3 revenues were $3M, which is down 21% YoY primarily due to the timing of processing at McClean Lake mill. Their net loss per share was ($0.01) for Q3. The McLean lake mill is one of the world‚Äôs largest uranium processing facilities and is currently processing ore from the Cigar Lake mine that is owned by Cameco. Cameco has shut down Cigar Lake twice this year due to COVID 19 concerns so you can imagine that would have an impact on Denison‚Äôs operating results.

From a pure uranium perspective, in Q3 Denison sold 26,004 pounds of U308 at an average price of $32.76.

For the Phoenix deposit, Denison estimates that their all-in cost is $8/lb of U308. With the current spot-price at $30 you can certainly see the appeal in that cost. Most producers do not have the cost basis to be successful at $30 and need $40-$60 in order to profitably mine their Uranium. With the Uranium spot price expected to increase to align with the average majority‚Äôs incentive price, you can quickly see where the appeal for Denison mines comes into play. Phoenix has about 60M lbs of the 109M pounds in the Wheeler River deposit so if you expect the spot price to double (which people are rarely questioning at the moment) you‚Äôre looking at >$3B of uranium at just Phoenix and slightly smaller amounts at the Gryphon deposit. If it triples? Well, you can do the math. The takeaway here is that they would be profitable even at today‚Äôs prices and that is not true for 99% of mines. Denison was 15x higher than today‚Äôs stock price during the last Uranium bull-run.

**What could go wrong?**

Permitting. Exploration and mining all require permits in order to be able to execute properly. As with other companies in the Athabasca Basin there is a Native Canadian population with which the land is shared and who need to be consulted. A good uranium company will work collaboratively with these stakeholders and not in spite of them. It is always a possibility they may oppose/block any actions.

ISR: ISR mining still needs to be approved by Canadian regulators. There is a possibility that the regulators come back and are not ok with this methodology and that would have a significant impact on Denison‚Äôs Phoenix deposit.

As always please do your own DD and happy to answer any questions. If people get some value from this then I'll keep posting.",1610651979.0

UNQL (INNO prior) has already operated 47 charter cargo aircrafts between September 1 and November 30, 2020 and has just announced that it has contracted a further 33 charter flights to operate between December 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021. The total contract value committed so far is in excess of $ 20 million. 

Personal basic analysis: 
With an Excess of $ 20 million revenue for just one 3 month contract of 33 flights. Based on math of 20million minimum divided by 33 flights = $600,000 revenue per flight x the 47 flights already operated sept-nov = $28.2 Million revenue + the $20 million = $48.2 M revenue for just September 2020-March 2021 = $6.8M/month minimum in contract revenue.

Hee guys! This is my first time posting. My first post was deleted because they thought i was mod. I cant blame them for that. Enyway after sorting that out, i can finally post my DD. I put a lot of effort in it, hope you guys enjoy it! 

 I was getting fed up that I could not find any DD about stock which hadn‚Äôt gone up 100-400% already. So I decided to do some research myself. I‚Äôve got a background in finance, so feel free to ask any question about unclarities. ( English is not my first language so go easy on me)

**What does TANH do?**

Zhejiang Tantech Bamboo Technology Co., Ltd. was established in October 2002. It is a leading high-tech enterprise, specializing in the R&D, manufacturing and sales of bamboo charcoal products for industrial energy applications and household cooking, heating, purification, agricultural and cleaning uses. It has an established domestic and international sales and distribution network. **In 2017, Tantech acquired a controlling equity interest in Suzhou E-Motors , which became known as Shangchi Automobile in 2019, and it began its business in electric vehicles manufacturing and sales.**

TRCH is trying to get a foothold in the EV marker and as we al know this is where the gains are made.

**Furthermore the company has solid numbers:**

The reason they are operating at a net loss in 2019. Is because they are investing a lot in the new EV side of the company. With green Biden coming to office, its most likely TANH is getting a huge boost.

**They are again operating at a profit:**

The best part is that the stock is trading at a very **low price: 1.69.** With only a **MCAP** of 60 million, that‚Äôs is absolutely nothing in comparison to the potential. The 200 day low is 1.30, so the downside potential is very little in comparison to other penny stocks.

200 day: low1.30 High 3.36 current 1.69

**Possible catalyst in the future:**

Tantech announced that it had launched a new driverless and fully autonomous street sweeper. This is a big deal for two reasons. For one, the competition in this area of the EV industry is limited. This means that Tantech could potentially have a higher chance of becoming the leading provider of these vehicles. Additionally, **if it can prove that these vehicles work well, the market demand could increase dramatically.**

I think it may start to move up significantly soon. For anyone who dosnt know what they do they are a major leader in the Ed-tech movement, mostly interactive displays, software and audio.

Basic stats.
Market cap: under 100 million -
Float: 44 million -
Revenue: 9 million plus about 15 from there new acquisitions -
Next quarter projection: 27 million and cash flow positive -
Cash: 9 million -
Debt: 22 million -

Basically with the acquisition of Sahara presentations they are extremely undervalued. Based on revenue alone they are undervalued. They are trading at less then a full years revenue. They have partnerships with Samsung that are just now coming online this quarter. The First Lady Jill Biden has phd in education and her career has been all about advancing the schools system. So education will have major funding. COVID has advanced the acceptance of distance learning by years, and while Boxlight is reliant on some classroom presence, the digitalization of the classroom will alow for hybrid learning which is essentially there calling card. There is a lot to like.

Things I don‚Äôt like is growth through acquisition which Boxlight has done a lot of, and not very well. They have a history over promising and under delivering. There debt isn‚Äôt huge but it‚Äôs something.

Why I think it will go up very soon. Basically people don‚Äôt realize how much money they are bringing in now. Sahara was very successful. Next earning a will be an obvious catalyst. And they have plenty of room to grow going forward.

EDIT

Just so everyone knows. When I say soon i mean a month or so possibly. I understand people look at penny stocks as never holds, but my experience trying to time the runs has not worked. Holding has. so I typically look to hold companies that I believe are undervalued. So don‚Äôt get annoyed if this dips a little or stays out till March or something.",1610652153.0

87,CCTL - CoinCitadel - Undervalued Bitcoin/Blockchain Miner,8,kxae5y,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kxae5y/cctl_coincitadel_undervalued_bitcoinblockchain/,8,"Been taking note of Bitcoin's run over the past year, and especially the past few months? Have you heard that large investment banks are buying into bitcoin now as they view it as something much more substantial than a project? Citi is calling for bitcoin to reach over $300,000 by the end of THIS YEAR?

We've all likely heard of well-known names in the space like MSTR, SQ and other large holders. There are companies that offer services around bitcoin/blockchain likely hosting companies, trading/investment firms and so on. Then there are the miners - the people & companies that do the hard work of solving equations to earn bitcoin.

There are only a handful of publicly traded miners out there. Some of the more well known tickers are MARA, RIOT and BTBT.

From my research, on the OTC there are several that are in the mining space directly.

* ARBKF (Argo Blockchain) - $1.68
* BFCH (BitFrontier Capital Holdings) - $0.046
* BTGN (Bitcoin Generation) - $0.54
* CBTC (XTRA Bitcoin) - $0.0082
* NODC (NodeChain) - $0.10
* MGTI (MGT Capital Investments) - $0.24
* SNLP (Syntrol Corp) - $0.02

The one I am focusing on with this post is **CCTL (CoinCitadel)**, based in the United States. Its share price is $0.0042 (at the time of writing).

CCTL is in my view not only the lowest priced security of the group but also represents the best value. It therefore provides the opportunity for the most upside. My thesis below.

**Point #1: Bitcoin holdings are severely undervalued.**

They have confirmed that they own 576 bitcoin in their treasury.

https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/d4d08b7b-b695-4529-9b23-a416a869ee7d/downloads/cctl%20dec%202105%20qtrly%20report.pdf

At today's price of roughly $39,000 per bitcoin that equates to a value of $22.5 million. The market cap of CCTL as of yesterday is $13.5 million. That is a gap of $6 million just to get to parity to its store of bitcoin, suggesting the stock should be *at least* $.006 (50% higher) on this point alone.

Obviously, if you believe that BTC is going to be 10x higher than currently by the end of the year then the company‚Äôs market cap should move in tandem.

Additionally, there may be more bitcoin in the treasury than the 576. They are actively looking for more...

""New management will do its best to find any dormant Bitcoin address or Private Keys to any lost Bitcoin if their existence  can be validated. We will also work on obtaining any Bitcoin due to the company from any previous stock deals arranged by the former CEO's if payment was rendered and verified Bitcoin addresses and private keys were not received.""

[https://coincitadel.net/financials](https://coincitadel.net/financials)

**Point #2: Valuation beyond treasury holdings is obviously very far behind peers.**

If the market isn't valuing their bitcoin holdings properly then there is no way the stock could be even close to its peers from a valuation perspective!

The company has stated that it owns ""a few hundred"" ASIC miners that mine primarily bitcoin along with other crytocurrencies (see the ""2019 Financials"" report on [https://coincitadel.net/financials](https://coincitadel.net/financials)). It hosted about 1000 miners from other companies with co-location but intends to over time run solely its own machines.

The total hashrate of its miners and the current number of miners is the subject of speculation the mere fact that they continue to mine would put the share price higher than simply the value of the BTC in the treasury. How much of a premium should be placed? It's hard to say but the market cap should reflect some kind of premium. Surely, this should put the stock price at significantly more than $0.006.

**Point #3: They have extremely low electricity costs.**

Electricity costs are the most important cost consideration for any bitcoin miner. As such it is a critical part of operations and profitability, especially as it gets more difficult to mine bitcoin.
CCTL is located in Plattsburgh, NY. Plattsburgh claims to have the lowest electricity rates in the country and possibly the world. That is due to a hydroelectric dam on the St. Lawrence river. Residents pay an extremely low rate and industrial concerns such as CCTL pay even less. This means that CCTL's mining profitability should be high, all else equal.

Interestingly new miners were temporarily banned from operating in the city or expanding operations if they currently existed in March 2018 due to their heavy power consumption but that ban ended in February 2019. Some fascinating reads & videos:

It seems as though the city wants to work with miners.

**Point #4. The company has stated it will become current with filings!**

The stock is currently on the Pink Sheets with a status of ""Pink No Information.""

[https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/CCTL/profile](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/CCTL/profile)

The last financial filing was the annual report for calendar 2015. That was on 2016.

However, on their website they recently updated their financials page. On this page they have indicated that they are planning to be ‚Äúcurrent and reporting‚Äù in 2021:

""Despite being a Pink non reporting company, Coin Citadel has posted 2017, 2018 and 2019 unaudited financials are below. 2021 Coin Citadel will be current and reporting.""

[https://coincitadel.net/financials](https://coincitadel.net/financials)

Also mentioned in a tweet: [https://twitter.com/CoinCitadelCCTL/status/1344782090534080514](https://twitter.com/CoinCitadelCCTL/status/1344782090534080514)

This is absolutely huge news as it will bring legitimacy and transparency to the operation in the eyes of investors, and hopefully a platform to move up OTC tiers. Compare that to other OTC miners who have gone completely dark.

**Point #6. The company is actively disseminating corporate information.**

They are involved and looking to reassure investors!

**Point #7: The CEO is a long time bitcoiner.**

Tom Pillsworth has been in the space since at least 2014. You could say bitcoin & cryptocurrency is all he knows! You can read more about him and his impressive background in the space on the company‚Äôs ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù page:

[https://coincitadel.net/about](https://coincitadel.net/about)

You would definitely want a person with significant experience in the space running your operations.

**Conclusion**

In my opinion CCTL is the most undervalued, least appreciated of all bitcoin mining stocks.

They have tons going for them including extremely low costs, holdings in treasury, mining operations, deep experience and a move for greater transparency going forward.

My view is that the stock should appreciate somewhere around 10x current levels, considering the above and the expected appreciation of bitcoin throughout the year. If the froth/mania gets really out of hand then the sky is the limit.",1610645740.0

One of the biggest challenges facing the medical community worldwide is the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Specifically, our global arsenal of antibiotics is threatened.

This isn‚Äôt an issue of production, or of limited supply. Rather, we‚Äôve used the same limited antibiotics to target microorganisms, and those same microorganisms have then responded by evolving to be resistant.

Consider staphylococcus aureus, one of the most ubiquitous bacteria in the world. It is the most common causative pathogen for cellulitis and other such conditions.

We used to treat it with methicillin, until it evolved to overcome it. Thus, there developed a new strain of it called MRSA (methicillin-resistant staph. Aureus). So we tried treating it with Vancomycin instead, but now there are VRSA (vancomycin resistant staph. Aureus).

What has become crucially apparent to hospitals across the world is that we have to be very selective in how we treat infections to prevent the development of super bacteria that are resistant to all known current drugs.

COVID has shown how vulnerable the world now is to infectious spread. Globalization will ramp up the rate of bacterial resistance, and new antibiotic-resistant strains of different pathogens literally threaten our very existence.

Now ‚Äî> ETTX is a company made up of former AstraZenica and Merck leadership who began in 2015 as a company seeking to develop solutions to alot of these potential calamitous pathogens.

Their stock is currently valued at ~ $2. They IPO‚Äôd at $13 and subsequently dropped to about $5. I believe that this is an accurate reading. I would put a PT of around $5-$7. 

This is different than a lot of niche penny stock companies because the potential market is waaaaay huge. Like every hospital will need it on hand huge.

Financials seem strong. Even though the stock price has fallen, their quarterly profits have been increasing in a linear fashion over the past year.

They currently have two drugs in phase 3 testing, and are waiting to hear back from the FDA later this year. FDA approval would be a major catalyst.  Their earnings have thus far been solid, and the leadership seems competent.

91,IBIO and EMBI,9,kx7tnl,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kx7tnl/ibio_and_embi/,9,"I believe both of these bad boys are about to be on a breakout trajectory.

I'm going to list my target exit price and then explain why I think it'll get there.

IBIO: $5-$7. Current Price: \~$1.40

EMBI: $1-$1.15. Current Price: $0.08

Now that I have your attention, here's why I think we'll get there.

&#x200B;

**IBIO**:

IBIO has a new CEO that's building a great team and revamping finance and clinical programs. They have several vaccines in pre-clinical trials like IBIO 400 and IBIO 200, but the one of most note is IBIO 201. IBIO has been experiencing a reverse trend recently. I believe in the next month there'll be an announcement about a new drug submission based on IBIO 201. Their CEO is coming in from GE Healthcare and is used to developing economies of scale.

**EMBI**:

They also have several drugs in pre-clinical trials, but around Glaucoma. Glaucoma is a >$1B sector with no real effective treatments, and they can position themselves up as a disruptor. The new CEO has previously taken biotech companies from OTC to public markets, and is a former INO vet. This company will be changing their name/ticker soon, so the name may change. But their pre-clinicals are showcasing great results in treating glaucoma. In Q2 we should hear a release from the company showcasing its results. EMBI is working with the University of Mississippi as well, which is the only institution allowed to grow cannabis. My timeline on EMBI is longer, as long as Q3 2021. It's very cheap right now, and I think that EMBI can run up in a manner similar to ZOM.

Disclaimer: I am invested 1,000 shares into IBIO and 10,000 into EMBI. I don‚Äôt want to mislead y‚Äôall into thinking that I don‚Äôt have some stake here.",1610638202.0

Efti safety profile from phase II trial:
https://jitc.bmj.com/content/8/2/e001681
""Results Twenty-four patients with melanoma received pembrolizumab and bi-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of efti at doses 1 mg, 6 mg or 30 mg/injection for up to 6 months (part A) or 30 mg/injection for up 12 months (part B). No dose-limiting toxicities were reported and the main adverse event for efti was injection site reactions. Sustained systemic exposure to the product was obtained in all patients following s.c. injections of 30 mg dose. Treatment induced an increase in activated CD8 and CD4 T cell counts, and in some of the soluble biomarkers, particularly interferon (IFN)-Œ≥, a Th1 signature cytokine. An overall response rate (ORR) of 33% was observed in patients partly with pembrolizumab-refractory of part A and ORR of 50% was observed in patients with PD-1 na√Øve of part B.

Conclusions Efti was well tolerated in combination with pembrolizumab with encouraging antitumor activity. This warrants further clinical studies of this new combination therapy combining an antigen-presenting cell activator with an immune checkpoint inhibitor.""

Financials:
IMMP is a company that hasn't turned a profit, it lost $13million last year. The details on the debt situation weren't clear to me looking at yahoo finance but there is no suggestion this company is at great risk of bankuptcy and the analysts mostly consider IMMP to be a buy with an average price target of $5.98 a share. Any more info I should include in this section please let me know and I'll update.

Bear Case:
This number of patients on these trials were relatively low, the trial is still ongoing with the collection of data to completed mid-2021.
The stock had already spiked to $7 when the trial data was released and came down from those highs and seems to be steady at around $3-3.50 range. It was trading at $2:16 prior to this news and at the time of writing this it is currently sitting at $3:27 which is a spike of 50% It is not impossible that the stock could return to trading in the $2 range.
The results of the new US trial starting this year could tank the stock if not able to replicate the positive results of the Australia trial, though I don't think we'll hear much about this trial for the next six months as it has just begun.
The company is loss-making and likely will be for a while to come.

So to summarise my opinion I think this stock has got a lot of potential and if the trials this year continue to show positive results which they already have I think the stock will blow those current price targets of $5.98 out of the water. 
I'd like to hear what you guys think and if you agree or disagree that it is a good buy at this price",1610624524.0

Over the last couple years, Avante Logixx has more than doubled in size through a series of strategic acquisitions and management says it is well-positioned for more growth and, just as important, earnings improvements over the coming quarters.¬†

2018 was a transformational year whereby Avante Logixx acquired Architronics (the remaining interest), Watermark Security, Veridin Systems Canada and Intelligarde International. As with most growth companies which undertake a series of acquisitions within a short period of time, they sustained losses from the added expenses incurred during the integration period.

Now the benefits of the Company‚Äôs investments and scale are showing results. As such Avante's financials have crossed the inflection point, whereby operating leverage has materialized, which has strengthened EBITDA and EBITDA margins, also leading to strong cash generation.

Today, the Company has two major platforms across six business segments that offer specialized security services, providing a strong foundation for future growth.

The larger platform is Logixx Security Inc., a full-service, one-stop shop security solutions provider for large, national multi-site enterprise customers where security is ""mission critical"" to success. Offerings to such enterprises include protective services, electronic security, cyber security, monitoring and managed services.

The Company has a diversified base of contracts with enterprise customers that are high in value and generate multi-year contractual revenue. Currently, Logixx Security comprises about 80% of Avante Logixx‚Äôs revenue base.

The remaining 20% of the Company‚Äôs revenue base is derived from Avante Security. Avante Security is a full-service, one-stop shop security solutions provider for ultra-high net worth residential clients for their homes, most of which are located in Toronto and Muskoka, Ontario. Revenues generated by Avante Security are mostly recurring on a monthly basis for monitoring services, plus security hardware installations.

The inflection point is most evident in Avante's recently reported fiscal Q2 fiscal 2021 financials. The Company generated record quarterly revenues from continuing operations of C$23.6 million for the three months ended Sept. 30, 2020.

This represents sequential growth of about 30% and 131% year-over-year growth. About 80% of the total revenues generated in this quarter are either multi-year contractual or monthly recurring in nature.

Avante also generated adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations during Q2 2021 of C$1.7 million or 7.3% of revenues, which is a sequential improvement of C$1.1 million or improvement of C$1.2 million from the prior year. This is a significant turnaround in profitability and is expected to continue.

Management and Board stock ownership is steadily increasing and the company has put in place share ownership guidelines, and compensation is linked to performance.

Based on the fact that Avante Logixx‚Äôs shares currently trading at a very low P/S ratio of 0.41 and has a predictable revenue model, when coupled with the EBITDA momentum reported, I believe there is strong stock price appreciation potential from its current trading levels.

&#x200B;

**Downsides**

* Gross Margin and EPS have slowly declined in last couple years. Although there has been significant margin improvements in their last quarter, it is too early to tell if this trend will continue.
* Total debt has also increased substantially in the last 2 years, however a large part of this debt can be attributed to a multitude of acquisitions and the added expenses incurred during the integration period.
* The CEO's salary is also higher than I would generally like to see for a company of this size. ($375k CAD)

This company currently has a 20 million dollar marketcap Canadian and has recently uplisted to the NASDAQ. They had a 9.6 million dollar public offering at a share price of 5.25 (USD) . source - [https://ceo.ca/@thenewswire/lexaria-bioscience-corp-announces-uplisting-to-nasdaq](https://ceo.ca/@thenewswire/lexaria-bioscience-corp-announces-uplisting-to-nasdaq)

What's interesting is that the public offering is priced in USD however at the time of the public offering it and reverse split, it was traded below 5.1 Canadian dollars. Warrants are exercisable at 6.58 USD and it is currently trading at 5.6 CAD.

So where I am going with this is that there is a mispricing that is leading to the share to be trading at a significant discount then what is intended as if we were to convert 5.25 USD to CAD it's public offering in CAD should be 6.67$, yet it is currently trading at 5.6 a significant discount from it's public offering. based on their presentation from Dec they have a 19.28% insider ownership ( probably less after this dilution).

Based on this information, the cash they have accounts for half of their market cap! (potentially more if we assume the public offering is in USD). This really sucks for the long-term shareholders, but great for newcomers.

Looking at the product they have to offer seems innovative and disruptive. Their DehydraTECH is an innovative oral delivery system with the following features:

* **increases bio-absorption by up to 5x,**
* **reduces time of onset from up to 1 ‚Äì 2 hours to just minutes**
* **masks unwanted tastes. and**
* **can reduce unwanted side effects by enabling lower overall dosing.**

Based on this, alone may have many uses in emergency situations if it's a time sensitive situation where delivery through intramuscular or intravenous is not practical.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N1krKKbWGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N1krKKbWGs)

The potential is incredible for this DehydraTECH as there are many drugs that may benefit from this innovative oral system, which can lead to many royalty opportunities for this company. They have a CBD and nicotine product and it has the potential to work with other antriviraldrugs

In conclusion, I believe we have a heavily mispriced ticker with lots of cash in hand relative to their marketcap that has just up listed to the NASDAQ. This ticker has a product that can potentially disrupt the medical world as its DehydraTECH supposedly increases the bioavailability . It is trading at all time lows with significant inside ownership.

The company has begun to plan its pivotal study and has retained Dr. Christine Brennan, recognized expert in carotid artery disease, as a consultant during the planning process.
* InspireMD **added Dr. Gary Roubin to its Board of Directors**. One of the most recognized interventional cardiologists in the world, Dr. Roubin‚Äôs pioneering work in carotid stenting and embolic protection devices brings knowledge and experience that will be invaluable. ¬†During his tenure as Chief of Interventional Cardiology at The University of Alabama at Birmingham and later as Department Chairman and Chief of Service of the Lenox Hill Hospital Cardiac and Vascular program in New York, he helped bring both programs to international standing in peripheral, neurovascular, and cardiac interventions.¬† Roubin‚Äôs vast clinical experience has enabled him to recognize and advance technical innovations that improve patient outcomes.¬† He played a pivotal role in the success of Mednova Inc., which was acquired by Abbott Vascular, resulting in the introduction and marketing in the U.S. of the top selling carotid embolic protection system (NAV6) and stent system (XACT).¬†

Statement from CEO (Summarized):

* Third quarter financial results return to pre-COVID revenue levels.
* Strategic pathway to growth for CGuard EPS is robust, rooted in broadening market share in endovascular carotid artery stent procedures in our served markets, while encouraging practitioners to make the shift from carotid endarterectomy to carotid stenting and launching our products in new countries.
* Another key goal is the initiation of their pivotal study in the United States - addition of Dr. Gary Roubin to BOD and Dr. Christine Brennan as strategic advisor - will be instrumental in the development and implementation of the trial.
* To meet the needs of each physician specialty, our strategy includes developing a new advanced tool set of adjunctive delivery system options including periprocedural embolic protection, specifically targeted for the vascular surgical community, all intended to drive adoption of CGuard EPS. These advances represent additional significant revenue pathways for InspireMD, and we are excited to broaden our portfolio and build on our growth and market adoption.

Financials:

* **Revenues increased by $41,000** to $980,000. -  ¬†This increase was predominantly driven by a 69.0% increase in sales volume of MGuard EPS.
* **2.2% decrease in sales volume** of CGuard Prime EPS - driven by procedures with CGuard EPS, which are generally scheduled or non-emergency procedures, only beginning to return to normal levels towards the end of the quarter as hospitals began to re-shift resources to non-COVID-19 patients.
* **Gross profit increased by 132.8%** \-  ¬†**Gross margin increased to 30.4%**
* As of September 30, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were **$10,882,000** compared to **$5,514,000** as of December 31, 2019.

100,Ozop Energy Solutions (OZSC) - Due Diligence,25,kwxqvm,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kwxqvm/ozop_energy_solutions_ozsc_due_diligence/,9," **OZSC**

**Background**

OZSC used to be in the business of providing surgical equipments / instruments back in the day. The company has now transitioned itself to a Renewable Energy Solutions company through the acquisition of Power Conversion Technologies (PCTI), which has an experience (30 years) as a manufacturer of high power solutions for the industry of Defense, Storage, Maritime, Power and others.

In other words, this transformation has given OZSC a very solid positioning and entry into a highly lucrative niche market that coincidentally is a market that will be looked at to solve the issues related to Carbon pollution, Charging Efficiency which is what the world in the next decade requires most country to home in on the Zero neutral carbon policy. 

&#x200B;

**The way forward**

The current management is working hard and smart in getting OZSC‚Äôs product offering to the Giants of the EV and ES industries. The most recent includes WESCO, which is a Fortune 500 Co. Due to the patented technology and design, the EV industry will be taking a very close look on OZSC‚Äôs ability to solve the issue of Charging Stations that can ensure the charge is done within a very very short time frame. As the world move towards a more cleaner infrastructure facilitated by the need for Electric Vehicles and Reliable Energy Storage, OZSC is in a catbird position to reap the potential opportunities and reward.

For a seamless Green Economy to function, requires an infrastructure that is safe, efficient and solid. EV Companies like NIO, Tesla, BYD, Nikola, Toyota, Blink, Fisker, Xpeng to name a few, is only a puzzle in this economy. The next puzzle which is critical to this economy would be the infrastructure, Charging Stations, Energy Storage‚Ä¶ is where OZSC can shine. Put that together, and you have a behemoth of opportunities in the making.

The energy storage landscape is the next puzzle in this jigsaw, where the current traditional grid to date as efficient as it may seem, requires a storage medium for the transfer of power and holding it for times of brown outs, blackouts or Emergencies. The power loss factor that occurs within the Utilities market worldwide is enormous. Storage is the solution. Not just any storage, but a damn good one is important. Tesla power packs is a fine example, and they require various components that makes it. OZSC again, is in that position to deliver on that promise on the component front.

&#x200B;

**Noise**

The bashers, pumpers and fence sitters. They‚Äôre all there for a reason. To get an entry, to make money, to bash, to pump. This are all white noise. The truth of the matter is this: OZSC has successfully transitioned itself from the previous past and somewhat tainted history (Brian has been called many names). Nevertheless, not only does the current management sees the potential opportunity and their position as a leading Energy solutions provider, the trust now giving by the likes of a Fortune 500s, 200 Cos and eventually from Energy Giants says only one thing: A Reborn OZSC that knows it‚Äôs time is NOW‚Ä¶ hence the frantic pace of management ensure every details is done to the T.

&#x200B;

**Catalyst** 

1. Master Sales Agreement with WESCO (Fortune 500 Co.) NYSE: WCC, with 30k Suppliers, and 70k Customers worldwide

2. JV with a Fortune 200 Co., to be announced soon.

3. Collaboration with the EV and ES giants, Exelon, Tesla, Emerson (Announcement soon)

4. Domestic market for Charging Station in the states of New York, Penny, Michigan etc. (Est. a USD 30 B CAGR 20-25% by 2025)

5. Entered into the Indian market, same timeline with that of Tesla, that market alone is worth USD 500 B.

6. Serving the Military, Airforce, Marine.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Due Diligence on your end is your best decision defense against all that noise. Once you‚Äôre arm with that knowledge, nothing can shake you. It‚Äôs your $ at the end of the day. Think +",1610596526.0
101,DD on Oncternal TherapeutüöÄcs $ONCT,13,kwwutm,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kwwutm/dd_on_oncternal_therapeutcs_onct/,9,"Oncternal Therapeutics is a clinical stage biotechnology compny focusing on the development of agents targeting a variety of cancers. Their lead product is a monoclonal antibody that targets ROR1, a rising star in oncology due to proven scientific evidence (see below). Most importantly, ROR1 is currently only being targeted by a handful of companies. VelosBio, a spinoff of ONCT, was recently acquired by Merck for $2.75 billion. NBE Therapeutics was recently acquired for \~$1.7 billion, and Juno Therapeutics (which does have a more developed pipeline) was acquired for $9 billion. **Oncternal currently only has a market cap of \~$250 million, and its data is better than its direct competitor, VelosBio. Oncternal is also trading at a fair value, with \~$125 million in cash.**

Oncternal has a year full of catalysts coming up:

Oncternal's pipeline also consists of a small molecular inhibitor, TK216, for the transcription factor ETS, which is associated with late-stage Ewing Sarcoma. Notably, TK216 has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation, Orphan Drug Designation, and Fast Track Status from the FDA. This month, Oncternal also initiated preclinical studies for CAR-T and CAR-NK cells targeting ROR1. They have indicated that the recent amount of cash they have raised will be used to develop this exciting product.

# Cirmtuzumab

**Oncternal Therapeutics owns the rights to develop a humanized monoclonal antibody, cirmtuzumab.** Cirmtuzumab is used to target MCL (leukemia), CLL (lymphoma), and breast cancer. Cirmtuzumab currently has orphan drug designation for MCL and CLL, and at the recent HC Wainwright Conference, the CEO of Oncternal said that accelerated approval for MCL is being discussed with the FDA. Cirmtuzumab targets ROR1, a tyrosine receptor kinase associated with **a primitive stem cell state that causes aggressive tumor growth.** Equally important, ROR1 is **almost only expressed on cancer cells**. This is why ROR1 is such a hot target--CAR-T cells, antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, can all be used to target cancers specifically, with minimal side-effects.

Data for cirmtuzumab is extremely favorable, especially for MCL.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pgk6jkgmx7b61.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=df4b94dbbfffb6918465df77eb10545236dbd040

Cirmtuzumab is being combined with a BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, the current top-of-the-line product for MCL and CLL. Treatment of patients with MCL resulted in **an astounding 87% objective response rate (ORR) and 47% complete response (CR)**, with durable complete responses, all in heavily pre-treated patients. This isn't just great compared to their competitors, this is top-of-the-line universally. Importantly, cirmtuzumab + ibrutinib was significantly better than prior studies with ibrutinib alone, which showed a 66% ORR and a 20% CR. All of this is has shown to be safe, too--no additive side-effects were shown when using cirmtuzumab with ibrutinib. CLL is slightly less exciting, but impressive nonetheless. Treatment of CLL with cirmtuzumab + ibrutinib resulted in a 88% ORR (ASH data), although improvement over ibrutinib has not yet been shown. After 12 months, all patients with CLL lacked progressive disease. There is currently little data for cirmtuzumab targeting breast cancer, but the data is nevertheless impressive. Combined with paclitaxel, a 57% ORR was recorded, compared to the historical 30% ORR. The safety profile was similarly stellar--improvements in efficacy did not cause an increase in adverse incidents.

# ROR1 CAR-T

There is minimal data for ROR1 CAR-T cells, but the proof of concept has been shown in mice. A major problem in developing CAR-T cells is the target--if the target is expressed abundantly on normal cells, severe side-effects can occur. However, ROR1 is expressed early in embryonic development, but switched off around birth. Except that is, on cancer cells. Data in mice CLL models shows impressive anti-tumor activity.

&#x200B;

[2nd row is the maximum dosage with ROR1 CAR-Ts. Even activating the T-cells of the mice does not show comparable anti-tumor activity.](https://preview.redd.it/fenusb7ox7b61.png?width=440&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2b0033bc774cd13ca65c21be99901385147ce88)

# Leadership

Some have concerns about leadership due to the recent offerings, but in my opinion these offerings are favorable as they position Oncternal in a great position to develop their ROR1 CAR-T/NK products, which have a crazy amount of potential. Currently, there is minimal insider ownership, which is not favorable, so it is important to keep an eye out for further dilution or any insider purchases. However, leadership is still very experienced and looks able to take Oncternal to the next level.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion:

Oncternal is poised to become the $TRIL of 2021. With plenty of cash stellar data leading the way, Oncternal should be valued at $1 billion plus (x4), comparable to their ROR1 competitors. Currently sitting at around $5.00 but a breakout should come soon, just need to be patient.",1610593450.0

And the list goes on and on... all this to say, this stock might actually be a jackpot. It's literally the key supplier that's plugged into the entire $2 trillion market ecosystem boost that's about to happen. I almost see this as an ETF of its own plugged into so many different industries and applications that'll moon under Biden's administration. This also has gotten the attention of Deadnsyde ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-EvW57Xoo&ab\_channel=Deadnsyde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV-EvW57Xoo&ab_channel=Deadnsyde)) which builds even more credibility. 

It has gone up a bit but this has much more room to run. Combined with tomorrow's announcement, I can see this easily hitting $20-30 in the near term, and even higher by eoy. 

For those wondering, here are the financials:

* No debt
* Positive operating profit (unlike some of those penny stocks that are bleeding money every year and have poor financials)
* Taken from Q3 2020 results transcript: "" Today, we announced revenues of $4.5 million and an operating profit of $253,000 for the quarter ended September 26, 2020.""
* What's shocking is that their full year revenue was struck heavily by COVID AND two of their major customers experiencing black swan situations but they STILL experienced positive growth compared to 2019. 

Don't miss this chance guys. Get in while you can when it's below $10!!",1610584844.0

Implied Volatility Surging for Riot Blockchain (RIOT) Stock Options

Zacks Equity Research

Mon, January 11, 2021, 5:51 AM PST¬∑2 min read


Investors in¬†Riot Blockchain, Inc.¬†RIOT need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 29, 2021 $30.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What do the Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Riot Blockchain shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Riot Blockchain is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Technology Services industry that ranks in the Bottom 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has narrowed our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from a loss of 10 cents per share to a loss of 8 cents in that period.
Given the way analysts feel about Riot Blockchain right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there‚Äôs a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

108,The Macro Business Case for Uranium,231,kwpx24,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kwpx24/the_macro_business_case_for_uranium/,93,"Hi /r/pennystocks,

Long time lurker and first time poster here. I have been an investor in Uranium since 2014 and have been patiently waiting for a bull-market to come. I believe its finally here and after seeing URG take off today, it looks like some other people on this subreddit think so as well. I am not going to share any picks right now, but I first want to share the macro case with this subreddit to educate a little bit on what you are investing in. Let me know your thoughts and what else you would like to know.

**#1 - What happened in the last Uranium bull market?**

The last uranium bull market took place between 2004-2007. The price of uranium is measured by a metric called the ""spot price"" and between that time period it grew from a price of $20/lb to $135/lb. The extraordinary climb was triggered by a flood at the mine one of the world's largest producers (Cameco). In this bull market valuations exploded. You have names such as Paladin which went up 200x. This bull was followed by ""mini-bear"" and ""mini-bull"" market where the supply situation started to stabilize and investment in new mines went through the roof until 2011. In this time period, uranium stocks went crazy. Investors were making 20x their money with their worst picks and hedge funds started manipulating the market with crazy money coming in and out to play the market. Unfortunately, the party was short-lived and in March 2011, a tsunami & earthquake struck Japan and triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster which obliterated the market overnight.

**#2 - What happened after Fukushima?**

After the Fukushima disaster many countries around the world immediately started the process of switching off their nuclear reactors and diverting away from Nuclear energy. An industry that had experienced a significant amount of investment had a lot of the demand dry up overnight. Obviously in turn, equities plummeted, many companies went bankrupt, and the sector was forever changed. After Fukushima, all the miners were left with big supply gluts. They had predicted nuclear to keep growing and instead they were struggling to find anyone to take this excess material. As such, there has been virtually 0 investment in new uranium mines since Fukushima and since 2011 the miners and the utilities have been working through the existing inventory.

**#3 - So what has changed to signal a bull market is coming?**

This is essentially a supply/demand story. I'm sure some of you have seen the market action with oil where countries manipulate the supply/demand and it has a huge effect on the price. In uranium, the producers have spent years working through excess inventory and since the spot price has stayed low, there has been no investment. 2018 was the first year on record where the Uranium industry produced LESS than the annual demand and this has continued for the last three years. At the same time, demand is growing and Nuclear reactors are going up across the world. China and other countries have several plants under construction and Japan is restarting a lot of the plants it shutdown after Fukushima. Additionally, the carbon reduction benefits of Nuclear are getting more and more support from both political parties. Both the democrats and republicans worked together (its possible!) to pass a couple bills recently that have been very positive for the Uranium industry. These included restricting how much cheap Uranium comes into the US and establishing a national reserve of Uranium in the US for security purposes. Overall, the macro sentiment is overwhelmingly positive and barring another nuclear disaster, this commodity is only headed up.

**#4 - Black Swan/COVID**

If the above isn't enough to get you excited, COVID has made this story even more convincing and has acted as a ""black swan"" for this industry. Because of COVID, the #1 and #2 producer in the world (Kazatomprom and Cameco respectively) both shut down production in order to keep their employees safe. So not only do you have an industry with a huge structural supply deficit, but the #1 and #2 producers essentially turned off the tap and decided they are not producing anymore. What could make this even more compelling? Well, these two producers still have contracts they have to fill and they need Uranium so instead of producing it they are actually buying it from other companies on the spot market to fulfill their needs. Can you imagine another industry where the #1 and #2 producers decide to stop producing and instead start buying from other companies? This further constricts supply and there is currently no end in sight to some of the mine shutdowns (Cameco specifically) that happened initially back in March due to COVID. So you have an industry with a big supply deficit, 0 investment in new mines, the top 2 producers are currently shut down, the top 2 producers have actually become buyers essentially arbitraging their own market and nuclear energy is growing. I'll let you make your own conclusions as to where this ends up.

**#5 - How do I make money?**

This industry is an extremely small industry. There are 2 (maybe 3) companies that are considered largecap and the rest are very small companies typically <$100M. Most of the companies would probably be defined as penny stocks.  The good thing is that most of the companies that are around today have managed to be prudent enough to survive the bear market so only the best have really survived. Because this is such a small industry, when money starts to actually come into this industry it will move violently and quickly. To start off I would recommend any of the big ETFs to get your feet wet such as URA or URNM. I am not going to post any specific picks at the moment as I would like to gage interest based on what I wrote and there is quite a bit of research behind these specific companies since they are so small.

**#6 - What could go wrong?**

At this point, the only catalyst that looks certain to kneecap the the industry overnight is a nuclear disaster and that is always a risk. From a safety perspective, all countries have spent a significant amount of money since Fukushima on upgrading their reactors to ensure they are as safe as possible so this risk is somewhat mitigated but it is always a possibility and one that you should be aware of.

Thank you for reading and happy to answer any questions you might have.

EDIT: Seems like there is a bit of interest in this space. I'll try to post a write-up on some of my favorites in the near future but PLEASE do your own due diligence. Uranium is a very volatile space and I would not invest money you cannot afford to lose. Please post your questions here instead of my DM so everyone can benefit.",1610571978.0
109,DD on Medcolcanna Organics $MCCN - the next big cannabis player üöÄ üöÄüöÄ üöÄ,8,kwppgd,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kwppgd/dd_on_medcolcanna_organics_mccn_the_next_big/,2,"Medcolcanna is a leading Colombian and globally integrated cannabis company. 

***Key highlights:*** 

¬∑ In February 2020 MCCN signed a Letter of Intent with Dona Blanca Limited, Dona Blanca will invest 2,040,000 CAD for a 15% ownership stake in Extralia Labs Sas, MCCN‚Äôs wholly-owned subsidiary (p14 interim statements), valuating this lab at around 13.6 million CAD. Which has a capacity of extracting 300 tons per year.

¬∑ MCCN received approval for extension of its cannabis cultivation licenses to its second location in Neiva for 32 hectares (approx. 79 acres) in October 2020. This farm is expected to allow MCCN to lower its cost of production by approximately four-fold, to compete in the commoditized CBD and CBG markets

¬∑ MCCN successfully completed exports of several of its product lines to the US and multiple European countries, including Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. These products included cannabis derivatives in bulk, as well as several products from its INVIMA-approved cosmetics line.

¬∑ The Greenstein Group Partnership agreement successfully delivered three exports to Germany. This partnership is expected to begin to import at least 100kg per month beginning in January 2021.

¬∑ MCCN also recently opened Medicina Nueva clinics, offering a comprehensive suite of health and medical services which include magistral formulations manufactured by MCCN's Soluciones Magistrales GEP-certified laboratories.

¬∑ This key accomplishment, achieved in October 2020, positions MCCN as the largest producer in Colombia with a total of 40 hectares (approx. 100 acres) under cultivation. This project should result in cost leadership in the region for the Company. As commodity markets for products like CBD and CBG derivatives have been driven down by low hemp prices in the US, MCCN's expansion into fully automated cultivation positions the Company to continue to lead on costs and enables the firm to produce high quality hemp and cannabis well below the cost of US hemp growers, positioning MCCN to compete in markets globally and improve gross margins. The first harvest and export of this production is scheduled to begin by the end of February of 2021. This facility is expected to have an annual capacity of 15,000 kg of CBD isolate.

¬∑ In Q3 and Q4, MCCN successfully exported several commercial shipments into Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. These commercial shipments are the first of recurring orders in these markets where sales have been developing for the last few months.

The Company is pleased to announce these series of key achievements accomplished by the Company during 2020 that cements the Company's position as a leader in the cannabis industry. Medcolcanna expects to embark into 2021 with operational and commercial advantages to exploit the local and international markets. These milestones allows the company to make a great forecast for 2021 they expect that the Company will reach self-sustainability and even profitability, based on the commodity business while simultaneously pursuing our pharmaceutical line of business to make high value added specific formulations and products through high R&D.

Because this TNT is about to explode.

Extreme Vehicle Battery Technology Corp is into everything in the green tech/EV market. AI battery failure detection, battery recycling and even energy storage and smart charging systems. You've heard of Tesla's powerwall right? These guys have their own version called the [Ionix Pro](https://www.prweb.com/releases/ev_battery_tech_unveils_the_ionix_pro_smart_wall_series/prweb17638137.htm) With specs that rival Tesla powerwall capacity at a lower entrance cost ($5500USD). They even have a TITAN series in production, for anyone that's going to complain that 15Kwh isn't enough.

I don't need to tell you that Batteries and energy storage is going to be the biggest component to ensuring renewables et al can support the capacity needed by homes, neighborhoods, cities, etc. Which leads to my next point.

They have an agreement to supply battery management systems, and smart charging systems for vehicles for an upcoming [Eco-village](https://cc8a054f-2d87-446b-bcaa-3b7bf80abf65.filesusr.com/ugd/db135f_ee44a00608f24db481c09fa1dec116df.pdf) in Squamish and Vancouver, B.C.

Last point. Battery recycling and USED battery repair for fuel cells that have lost the typical 20% functionality loss where most batteries are deemed unusable. Using AI analytics they can test and determine whether these batteries can be refurbished back to 100% or reused as a storage system.

I know this is Penny Stocks and not wall street bets so I'm not going to call anyone autists for missing out on this opportunity 2 weeks ago when it was trading at .04c, I missed it myself.

The company has three operating segments. The inpatient services segment include the operation of skilled nursing facilities and assisted/senior living facilities; rehabilitation therapy segment services include integrated and third-party rehabilitation and respiratory therapy services; and all other services. The majority of its revenue is generated from its skilled nursing facilities of the inpatient services segment.
They have nearly 400 skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities across 26 states, one of the largest rehabilitation therapy companies in the nation for its patients and residents. 
Not to mention they have 55000 full time employees unlike most penny stocks that have 2-30 employees lol
On the 5th of January they announced a leadership change; Robert H. Fish as the new CEO who has a neat track record; which is why it‚Äôs climbing.
Good luck!

115,üöÄ¬£BMNüöÄOverlooked üöÄHIGH GROWTH GEMüöÄ by the street with both Covid recovery and EV play,13,kwnwft,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kwnwft/bmnoverlooked_high_growth_gem_by_the_street_with/,23,"¬£BMN - Bushveld Minerals Limited

Obviously not encourage anyone to buy without doing proper DD. However, as a long time user benefiting from this sub I thought should give back a bit. I believe this stock is easily a 5-bagger with potential of 10x. IMO it offers drooling risk-reward that not many in the market can compete with. **If you missed $TSLA/ $NIO, this is your chance to let you money multiply.**

Background

\- A vertically integrated ***low-cost*** ***high-grade*** vanadium miner in SA, mainly sell to EU, US and more recently China;

\- Vanadium is mainly used in alloy for strengthening, widely used to make rebar (construction material). It's also key ingredients for Vanadium Redox Battery, which is seen by the industry as solution to energy storage issue (i.e. solar, wind) to replace Lithium (think EV, clean energy trend);

Investment case

1. up 200% since pandemic low due to easing of lockdown as BMN derived significant revenue from China where govt initiatives to revive economy through infra and constructions, hence demand for rebar expected to rise (*China has done well through Covid so can expect recovery/ high growth while others still struggling*);
2. Vanadium price is at historically low of the decade - limited downside risk with large upside opportunities;
3. Abundant mine reserve for long term development (No concern of running out of Vanadium) - **c.3000t for FY19 but reserve of 500Mt**;
4. Solid fundamentals: at FY20 interim, very low debt with debt/equity 22%, ¬£24m cash vs ¬£266m market cap means you **get 10% off current price**. Pandemic has been an exceptional year for industrials but solid profit every year prior;
5. Bonus point: ¬£BMN now is the sole owner of Bushveld Energy Ltd which develops the Vanadium Redox Battery, which has the advantage of unlimited recharge, does not explode like lithium and low costs. This means ¬£BMN is able to ride the Ev/clean energy trend with a self-sustained supply chain at low costs;
6. At a market cap of ¬£266m, 10x only gets it to ¬£2.66bn, which is a fraction of $TSLA - much easier to compound your money with small caps.

Apparently institution believed in it as shown below. But it's a small cap in a boring industry so probably didn't draw much of the attention of street analyst, which is good thing for us.

116,HIVE.V - Debenture Closing & Position,0,kwnoid,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kwnoid/hivev_debenture_closing_position/,9,"TSX.V: HIVE, OTCQX: HVBTF, FSE: HBF

Yesterday, [HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. closed their Convertible Debenture Private Placement](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/hive-blockchain-announces-closing-usd-060000131.html) which provided them an aggregate gross proceed of $15M USD. This debenture placement was announced on December 24th. Since then, [the company has purchased 4,180 MicroBT WhatsMiner M31S+ miners](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/hive-blockchain-doubles-bitcoin-production-060500674.html), adding 334 Petahashes/s (PH/s) to their current operating aggregate hash rate of 319 PH/s. This will effectively double their operating hash rate through 2021.

**The Purchase:**

* [At a price of ~1680USD](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/whatsminer/microbt-whatsminer-m31splus-sha256-80ths/), 4180 MicroBT WhatsMiner M31S+ miners costs approximately $7M USD before fees/taxes. This is less than half of the company's $15M gross intake from their debenture placement. If the company continues to invest in miners/infrastructure in the rest of 2021, we can expect the company's operating hash rate to increase beyond the total 653 PH/s including the current purchase. Importantly, this purchase does not put the company in the red.
* The 4180 miners being purchased are being delivered slowly through 2021, with 180 arriving in April, and 500 per month for the rest of the year. Revenue from these miners will be realized slowly over time.

**History:**

* Steady quarter over quarter gain in revenue through 2020, with profit growing following the same time frame.
* Positive earnings all of 2020.
* Growing cash quarter over quarter through 2020, excluding the debenture placement.
* $1B market cap.
* 6M average volume.

**Catalysts:**

* Q4 2020 earnings report releasing March 2021
* BTC/ETC price swings

**My opinion:**

The last thing that ties everything together is what is relevant for all crypto mining companies, the value of the asset they're mining. Huge spike in Ethereum (ETH) price in December might show big potential for Q4 2020 earnings report. Even without new miners, it was possible that HIVE could see revenue increases in 2021 due to ETH interest. With the miner purchase, it allows HIVE to soften the blow of ETH dropping, and compounds the gains if ETH rises again. IMO, I think crypto will peak again in 2021, so for me it's a matter of choosing which companies to invest in. HIVE looks like it has good books, no artificial pump from any recent catalysts (excluding overall crypto market trends), and they will at least double their hashrate in 2021. HIVE has higher revenue today than comparable companies HUT or BITF (albeit those companies combined have HIVE's market cap). I also think the slow release of the miners over time will make HIVE's books look great quarter over quarter in 2021 since the cumulative hashrate will increase steadily instead of all at once (assuming ETH price is relatively steady or positive). **Overall, I think HIVE will gain based on the amount of hash power that they will accrue and how good their earnings will look in 2021.**

From 10,000ft, all mining companies' stock performance is swinging with ETH/BTC price trends. My plan is to buy more HIVE as it falls where I think ETH/BTC dips are (like this week) and wait for catalysts through 2021.

TL;DR: Good revenue + good year for ETH (tbd) + investment in hashrate = üöÄ",1610565632.0
117,TSXV: QMC OTC: QMCQF How Quantum minerals is tackling the growing lithium industry,2,kwn1lp,pennystocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kwn1lp/tsxv_qmc_otc_qmcqf_how_quantum_minerals_is/,1,"Everyone knows Tesla, NIO, etc and all these EVs are taking over the car industry. With the shift to renewables as well, battery demand is expected to rise significantly, and lithium demand will rise with it. 

Quantum minerals owns two extremely advanced stage projects, that both have existing infrastructure. 

Their irgon lithium mine project is especially interesting with it having a shaft already drilled and previously owned by the lithium corporation of canada in the 1950's. It's at just 20km of the TANCO mine, north america's most successful Lithium mine to date. It has the potential for 5M+ tonnes of lithium worth over $2B. 

With the company's market cap being $21M right now, there's tons of room for growth. 

Have a look at their website! [https://qmcminerals.com](https://qmcminerals.com) 

The CEO Balraj has an insane background as well, he built the first residential high rises in Richmond, BC with 4 towers, 391 units and also was part of the management team that made canada's only private airport.
